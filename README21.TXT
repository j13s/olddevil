Hi.

This is a short remark to well experienced Devil users.
For further documentation look at the file readme.txt and the file
docs/userman.doc.

This is the full version of Devil V2.1f.
Please, please e-mail me all bugs you encounter. 

FOR DESCENT 2 MODE, DEVIL NEEDS THE MEDIUM (48MB) INSTALLATION. Sorry about
this, but I can't access the data from the CD, it is packed (I think).
I will see if I can change this with the next version.

Fixed problems/changes (V2.1d->V2.1f):
-fixed major (and very old) bug in 'make macro'. Deleting cubes in 
 new made macros (without saving the macro) should work now.
-fixed bug in Texture list and switching side from a normal side to a 
 wall side. Furthermore the bug with wrong texture size in T2 window and
 the wrong offsets and the crash in 640*480.
-cfg-file is saved with Devil version now, so old config files are 
 automatically deleted.
-fixed the damn bug with saving new levels.
-fixed problems with Descent 1 textures (only Descent V1.0 version).
-fixed problems with configuration with "Descent Destination Saturn"

A BIG thanks to all guys at the mailing list and all others for bug reporting
and making suggestions.

This is still a prerelease, so be careful and make backups of your levels. 

If you have any questions, please mail them NOT to me directly but to the NEW
Devil Mailing List (see readme.txt) -- thanks to Stephen P. Clouse who
worries about it. I am subscribed in the new mailing list, too, so I will
receive everything you send to it (and a lot of other people will receive it,
too, and can answer your questions).

Have a good time,
Achim

PS: Next version:
 - bug fixes.
 - V2.2 will be with a corridor generator & two different views for
   one level, so you can drag things & points with the mouse.
 - don't know. Still a lot of things to do, like a undo, texture mapping etc.
