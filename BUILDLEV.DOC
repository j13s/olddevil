      I first intended to write a short documentation about building a small
      level with DEVIL but then I noticed that I should explain things more
      thoroughly. So I wrote 'DEVIL.DOC' (ok, you mustn't read that first but 
      you should read it sometimes because not all functions are explained
      here). 
      I've also made another level (without step-by-step documentation) to 
      show how producers and switches work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [A]. A LEVEL FROM THE SCRATCH

--[A1]------ Moving around
      
      To control your movements with your mouse just click on the arrows to 
      the right: left click is turn and right click is move. On the keyboard 
      the commands are (you have to switch the NUMLOCK ON):
        A/Y (perhaps Z ?)       forwards/backwards (sorry, german keyboard)
        1/3                     banking
        2/4/6/8                 turn around
        [SHIFT]+2/4/6/8         gliding
      IMPORTANT: when I refer to NUMLOCK ON or OFF, I assume that you change
      the Move/Modify-mode ONLY with your NUM-key.  
      If you want to move something else instead yourself you have to switch 
      the NUMLOCK OFF (or click on the button below the arrows). You can only
      move tagged objects. Normal objects are moved relative to your point of 
      view but things with orientation (starts, robots and the reactor) are
      steered (just lik you would fly them). Just try it.
      
--[A2]------ The modes

      You change modes by pressing [CONTROL] and the first letter of the mode 
      That would be '[C]+S' for side-mode, '[C]+P' for point-mode, .... You 
      will notice that every time you change the mode the display in the 
      upper right corner will change to display your possibilities of editing 
      the current object. The Internal menu is the most complicated: here you 
      can enter the move-factor, the angle of your turns when you press 
      2/4/6/8, ...
      If you want to go to another cube (well, if you'd have more than one :) 
      just press 'c' for the next or '[S]+c' for the previous cube. That is 
      's' or '[S]+s' for sides, 't' or '[S]+t' for things, ... When you 
      change sides, you will always remain in the same cube; when you change 
      points you will remain in the same side. When you want to change seve-
      ral objects, e.g. the textures of all walls in a level, you may find it 
      handy to 'tag' objects. This is possible in every mode by pressing 
      '[SPACE]'. '[S]+[SPACE]' tags/untags every object in the level.

--[A3]------ Substructures

      When you change tho mode you'll notice that the display in the upper
      right corner changes: it displays the substructures of the current 
      object. You may change them using the cursor keys and [RETURN]. 
      Example: substuctures of walls are: door-type, open-type, open at end-
      type, switch-type, texture-type and animation texture-type (latest only
      for doors).
      Now go to cube-mode ('[C]+c'). Let's suppose you want to change the 
      light-level of this cube (in the substructures): just go to 'lights' 
      using the cursor-keys and press [RETURN].
      If you've chosen sth. wrong just press [ESC]. This will quit the 
      current menu. Now you may enter any value from 0000 to 8000 (hex). This 
      will change the light level in the whole cube. Sometimes it is 
      necessary to change the light level for each side seperately (e.g. when 
      there are lights on the ceiling). This is done in the side- or point-
      mode.

--[A4]------ Macros and deleting

      OK, after you get used to the different controls let's try our first 
      macro. Go to side-mode ('[C]+s') and choose a side with the texture 
      'rock001'. Press '[S]+m' to make a macro (or use the pulldown-menus). 
      This macro consists of the current cube and all tagged objects 
      (including walls and things). To insert a macro press [INSERT] if you 
      want to keep the cubes seperate or '[S]+[INSERT]' if you want an 
      connection between the cubes. This is only possible in cube-mode, so 
      you better press '[C]+c'. Do this now (and since you want to fly 
      through this level you should use '[S]+[INS]' :). The inserted cube is 
      blue (that is: tagged). This is because it is very easy to make things 
      wrong with macros. So if you just inserted a macro and want to delete 
      it just press [DELETE]. This will delete every tagged object (hence the 
      name). 
      Now compare the cubes (especially concerning the lights, they should be 
      on the same side on both cubes). Most certainly you've made a mistake 
      so that you have to delete the cube. Now try it again while I'll try to 
      explain just HOW this damned macros work (I got it wrong some zillion 
      times myself). When you make a macro, DEVIL takes the current side and 
      point. When you insert a macro, DEVIL takes the current point and side 
      and tries to mend these with the point and the side of the macro. DEVIL 
      will therefore turn the cube in the macro to match the two points and 
      sides. Just keep trying until you get the hang of it. 
      Build a corridor with a length of 9 standard cubes (corridor 1) and add 
      another corridor of the same length to the 5th cube (corridor 2).
      Go to the last wall of corridor 2 and press [END]. This will make the
      exit-wall which is needed for every level.
      It schould look like 'tut1.rdl'

--[A5]------ The separating and joining of cubes

      Now we'll play a bit. Switch to side-mode and choose a wall (a wall is
      a side with an adjacent cube). Tag it and move it around: see how the
      cubes are connected? Now press [INSERT]. This will cause DEVIL to se-
      parate the two cubes (it will change the wall in two sides). Move the
      tagged side and notice the difference. When you want to join two cubes
      you have to tag one side, then go to the side with which you want to 
      connect the tagged side. Now press [DELETE]. This will connect the 
      cubes (it changes the two sides into a wall). If the two sides aren't at 
      the same position, DEVIL will try to adapt the tagged side to the 
      current side (which will remain the same).

--[A6]------ Textures

      Texture changing is easy: just switch to side-mode and choose texture 1 
      or 2. Texture 2 is used for signs, monitors or lights. It will lay on 
      texture 1. Some textures (like lava) are special. These are handled 
      automatically by DESCENT (it's a GREAT game). Change some textures and 
      notice that when you change texture 1, texture 2 (the lights) will 
      remain the same. You may want to change the orientation of the second
      texture: do that with 'change orientation'.

--[A7]------ Walls

      Walls are sides between cubes. They may have different functions: 
      switches (for doors or producers), doors, only texture or just plain 
      nothing. A wall may even be a door AND a switch. 
      We will make two doors now:the first at the joining of corridor 1 and 2 
      and the second in corridor 1 so that there is just one cube left 
      Change to wall-mode and change the side of the cube so that the side in 
      which you want to insert the door is red. Then press [INSERT]. Now 
      let's change the types of the doors: the door at the intersection is 
      'stay open, switch' (means you can't open it) and 'open at end' (means 
      it will open when the reactor is blown up). In addition to that you 
      should set the switch to 'normal exit' (means exit). This is the normal 
      exit-door.
      The second door is 'open/close w. laser' and 'red key'.
      You are now at 'tut2.rdl'.

--[A8]------ Things
      
      Things are Robots/Items/Weapons. Switch to thing-mode and press 
      [INSERT]. An energy boost will appear (default). Switch him into a red 
      key using the upper right menu. If you put the red key behind the red 
      door you get 1000 points for intelligent behaviour: either delete it 
      (tag it first, but remember that you can't delete the active object) or 
      move it around (tag it and switch NUMLOCK OFF). Now go to the cube 
      behind the red door. Insert another thing and switch it to reactor. 
      Since the reactor is kind of special you have to change the cube-type 
      as well. Go into cube-mode and switch the cube-type to reactor.
      You may also want to insert a robot: insert another energy boost in 
      another cube and change it's type to 'robot'. Now choose a robot and, 
      if you want, an item that the robot will drop (drop-type 'drop item'; 
      choose item out of list and enter a drop-number)

--[A9]------ Exit

      The exit of a level is build a bit more complicated than in DOOM. First
      there is the exit-door: it never opens until the reactor is blown up.
      This wall is also a switch: when you pass it, the computer takes con-
      trol over your ship and steers it through the last corridor until the
      real exit is reached. Therefore an exit consists of 'stay open, switch'
      'open at end' and the switch 'normal exit'.
      The exit-side is the only side that is a wall (not quite right but it 
      should do). Therefore you should bend the corridor so that the exit
      wall can't be seen from the beginning of the exit-corridor (because of
      HOM-effects). I've not done so because it's only a stylistic fault and 
      won't do any harm.
      The exit-corridor should also have a certain minimal length (try sth
      around 10 cubes at least) and it shouldn't have sharp corners (no 90ø 
      turns).
      Your level is now ready and should look like 'tut3.rdl'.

--[A10]----- Merging the level in DESCENT

      You don't have to merge them. Just only rename them in 'levelXX.rdl'
      where XX ranges from 01 to 27 including S1,S2,S3 (for secret levels).
      DESCENT will load this levels instead of those in the .HOG-file.

--[A11]----- Stylistics

      Here are just some tips what you should try to do/don't :
      - don't make the exit-corridor too short/straight (see exit)
      - insert the reactor in standard cubes so that they won't float (or
        steer them to the floor in a bigger room)
      - default texture for doors is rock001; you don't see it a lot but 
        change the texture to match adjacent textures 
      - ceiling (lights) and floor (tiles) should remain the same through the
        whole level
      - monitors and signs should be orientated in the same way
      - when you make a macro for public use, try to end it with a standard
        cube (reference point and side)
      - thank PARALLAX every day
      - be happy :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [B]. DEMO-LEVEL

      I'll just describe what you see when you fly through this level. First,
      there is a two-sided (means two different events, depending of your
      direction) switch for the producers. Then there is a energy-station
      (note: try to achieve a high 'wall-density' in energy-stations 'cause
      when you turn you see that the flocks in the air are just 2D). Next,
      another two-sided switch for two secret doors. The door to the left is
      'open/close w. switch' (means: it will close after some time), the 
      other is 'not normally opened' and will stay open when opened once via
      switch. First type is great for secret doors with goodies behind, second
      is for traps with robots. Then you'll pass a door and enter a BIG BALL
      (my first real macro :). This room  may be a bit slow on some machines 
      (mine for example). There will be another enemy and the reactor.
      Notice the mind-wheeling effect corridor <-> ball? 
      
      Sorry, the producers didn't work and you couldn't load this level in 
      DEVIL. This is because we've packed the wrong file (it was compiled 
      with an earlier version of DEVIL). The one included in this pack should
      work properly.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [C]. CHANGES 

      - explained a bit more so that you won't need to read 'DEVIL.DOC'
        (mainly 'Moving around', 'Substructres', 'The separating and ...')
      - explained the exit structure a bit better
      - some minor/major changes of the demo-levels
      - updated informations about loading own levels in DESCENT
      Anyone had problems? I can try to explain things a bit better because
      since I'm working with DEVIL such a (relative) long time I've problems 
      deciding what is obvious and what should be explained.
