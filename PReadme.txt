Devil v2.2lc2 Windows XP PATCH
By "Pumo" (digipumo@hotmail.com)
--------------------------------
HOW TO INSTALL:
Copy all the files from the zip (including folders) to the
directory where Devil is and overwrite all files.
A XP icon with alpha blending is available in case you want to
use it on a shortcut on the desktop, etc...
--------------------------------
HOW TO USE IT:
Simply run PDevil.Bat located in your Devil directory.
--------------------------------

This XP patch consists of some Batch files
modified in order to use Devil on
XP computers.
However, this patch will only work with
the DevilX v2.2lc2 version by Lars Christensen.

Also,since DevilX requires the original Devil
v2.2l so this patch will require it also :).

I don't know if it will work on any XP computer,
but at least ran on the one i have
(Pentium 3 866MHz,128MB RAM,Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2).

I hope this version will be useful for the old-school users of devil that
have Windows XP.

If you have some problem using this patch, don't hesitate to send me an E-Mail to

Well, enough talking, enjoy it! :).
