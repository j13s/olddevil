/*  DEVIL - Descent Editor for Vertices, Items and Levels at all
    credits.h - the credits. if you falsify it, Devil will format
     your harddisk and let your monitor explode. if you've done some
     work on Devil you can put a note inside but better idea is to
     sent me your work so I can do the note inside and your work in
     Devil.
