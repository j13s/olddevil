Hi.

This is a short remark to well experienced Devil V2.0? + V1.02 users.
For further documentation look at the file readme.txt and the file
docs/userman.doc.

This is the full version of Devil V2.1a. There will be no final
V2.00 release...
 
Fixed problems/changes (V2.0i->V2.1a):
-Descent 2 support
-Texture Lists
-fixed the bug with "delete cubes" (I hope)
 
A BIG thanks to all guys at the mailing list and all others for bug reporting
and making suggestions.

This is still a prerelease, so be careful and make backups of your levels. 

If you have any questions, please mail them NOT to me directly but to the NEW
Devil Mailing List (see readme.txt), a thanks to Steven P. Clouse who
maintained the old mailing list and to Joi Ellis who tried to establish a new
mailing list. I am subscribed in the new mailing list, too, so I will receive 
everything you send to it (and a lot of other people will receive it, too, and
can answer your questions).
