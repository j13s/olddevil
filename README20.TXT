Hi.

This is a short remark to well experienced Devil users.
For further documentation look at the file readme.txt and the file
docs/userman.doc.

This is the full version of Devil V2.1d. I hope that this can get a 
V2.10 release, so please mail me all bugs you find.
 
Fixed problems/changes (V2.1c->V2.1d):
-Fixed major bug with loading Descent 1 levels with switches in D2 mode.
-The textures from D1 levels are now converted in D2 mode (but only a few
 correct).
-Fixed problems with animated textures and texture list
-Fixed problems with Descent 1 textures
-top/up/down buttons use the selected texture list (even when the list
 window is closed).
-Fixed the problems with the grfx for the flags (finally :).
-The mines are exploding properly now and can rotate.
-Fixed bug with small sides and light sources in mine illuminating
-Help key is back
-Menuepoint 'New level'
-Make room is back.
-A tag filter is available. Press CTRL+left mouse button on an arbitrary
 button (including the texture list) to tag all objects with this data
 and CTRL+right mouse button to untag all objects with this data.
-'split cube'-feature is new. 

A BIG thanks to all guys at the mailing list and all others for bug reporting
and making suggestions.

This is still a prerelease, so be careful and make backups of your levels. 

If you have any questions, please mail them NOT to me directly but to the NEW
Devil Mailing List (see readme.txt) -- thanks to Stephen P. Clouse who
worries about it. I am subscribed in the new mailing list, too, so I will
receive everything you send to it (and a lot of other people will receive it,
too, and can answer your questions).

Have a good time,
Achim

PS: Next version:
 - bug fixes.
 - V2.2 will be with a corridor generator & two different views for
   one level, so you can drag things & points with the mouse.
 - don't know. Still a lot of things to do, like a undo, texture mapping etc.
