problems and questions concerning Devil (and other Descent Editors). For
further information see<p>

functionality of Devil. <br>If you have any problems, please address your

Translator's Note:<p>
<p>
Any handbook dealing with a 3-D environment is bound to encounter difficulties
of expression whichever language is used due to the complexity of the topic
itself. While every attempt has been made to preserve the form and tone of the
original, changes have had to be made in order that this English version be
both coherent and legible. Preference has been given to ensuring that the
manual text makes logical sense, bearing in mind that the primary function of
this document is to serve as a practical guide to using Devil and not simply an
exercise in semantics.<p>
<p>
Despite the above, there are certain instances of terminology which, while
grammatically incorrect or confusing, have been left in the document due to
these terms either having become widely accepted historically or appearing in
Devil menus under that name. American English spelling has been chosen in
deference to the expected majority usage.<p>
<p>
The reader is referred to the terminology discussion in Section 8.2<p>
<p>
During the translation it became apparent that the original German version did
not contain many items of interest to the level builder as are often discussed
on the Descent Developers List. Many comments from my own experience, those of
the proof-readers as well as some things gleaned from the list have been added.
Wherever practical this has been indicated so to differentiate between Achim's
first person comments and my third person comments.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Many thanks to Achim for his dedication in providing us with such a great tool
for building Descent levels ... and it's still <i>free</i> !<p>
<p>
A round of applause for Lars Christensen, Rob Hastings and Gordon Pedley ...
brave souls who volunteered to help me with the proof-reading of this monster.
Thanks guys.<p>
