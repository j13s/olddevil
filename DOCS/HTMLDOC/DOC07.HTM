<h2>
<A NAME="Heading68">6.1 BASICS</A></h2>

The
real reason for the texture functions of Devil is, for example, to make it
possible to align a texture with lights onto a slanted Side in such a fashion
that the lights are set in the middle so as not to display half a light.
Readers who only want to adjust textures in this manner (which I strongly
recommend initially ) should skip this section. Readers who want to make doors
four times the size and other similar things, however, should read this section
to the end.<p>
If you want to place textures differently to normal in Descent, you must
understand the methods and ways in which textures are handled by Descent.
Descent requires an Outline (or frame-definition) on which the texture is to be
pasted in order to be able to represent it. This Outline is normally calculated
automatically by Devil, but you can also change it manually. Descent does
nothing other than compare this Outline with that of the Side actually to be
produced on the screen and then fills the Outline on the screen with the
corresponding texture. This means that if in an Outline, the line from Point 0
to Point 1 has a length of 1 and the Outline on the screen has a length of 2 ,
the pixels which lie on these lines in the Outline are all doubled.<p>
The standard-size of a Side in Descent is 20*20, i.e., a side this size
corresponds to a single texture after automatic calculation.<p>
<u>Example:</u> If a normal texture-size Outline is specified in Devil for a
square side 40*40 in size, you have a 40*40 opening, i.e. the door is four
times as big as usual. If the Outline is automatically calculated by Devil you
will get four 20*20 doors because the Outline is 2*2 textures in size.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading69">6.2 ADJUSTING TEXTURES ON SIDES</A></h2>


<IMG SRC="align.gif" align=left>
The most frequent problem with textures in Devil is that the lights (amongst
other things) of a texture which is placed on a slanted wall are not in the
middle.

It can happen, for example, that the lights on a slanted wall appear as show in
Diagram 1 instead of as they should, as shown in Diagram 2. To correct such a
problem you can either move the texture directly with the mouse in the level
window (see Section 3.4.2) or click on the displayed texture in the Side
window. The latter opens a new window in which the outline of the side is
displayed with the texture in the background.<p>
When this "Fit texture" window is opened, the `Movemode' status is set to `Move
texture' and the six large push-buttons apply to movement and resizing of the
Outline. Again left and right mouse-buttons have different effects ...
experiment !<p>
If you click the right mouse-button in this window, you can move the texture in
the following manner:<p>
*	Only right mouse-button: Enlarge/Reduce the Outline; Turn.<p>
*	Shift+right mouse-button: Shift the Outline. If the Outline `jumps' while
moving, it is because Devil has decided that your offsets are unnecessarily
large. Unnecessary, since the texture bitmaps are repeated every 64 pixels and
for that reason it is not necessary to offset any co-ordinate more than 64
pixels.<p>
*	Left+right mouse-button:  Shrink or stretch in the x/y-direction.<p>
Additionally you can shift individual points with the left mouse-button.<p>
Translators Note: You can create some pretty bizarre effects by `folding' the
outline in the align window to look like an hourglass... especially with the
animated textures, both Devil and Descent (2) support this.<p>
Changes to the Outline are accepted when the texture in the Side window is
clicked again (using the left button for the Outline of the current side only,
the right for all tagged sides).<p>
Double-click with the left mouse-button in the texture-alignment window to
reset the co-ordinates of the Outline of the current side to what they were
before you activated the alignment window; if you press Shift simultaneously
then the Outline co-ordinates are re-calculated according to the current side;
if you press Alt simultaneously a `Standard outline' is created, i.e., the
Outline fits the texture exactly (which, e.g., can be useful with large square
walls four times the standard size).<p>
You should only adjust the texture Outlines on the side once the shape of the
side in the level has been finalized, because Devil re-calculates the Outline
with every alteration of the shape of the side (unless the side is locked, see
Section 4.3). Although Devil attempts to keep the position of the Outlines
unchanged, it is sometimes just not possible.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading70">6.3 AUTOMATIC TEXTURE ALIGNMENT</A></h2>

This function is useful for textures with particular structures, which must be
fitted together across multiple sides as, for example, the floor in the first
room of Level 1 in Descent 1. In order to place these textures together, you
must tag all sides whose textures should be aligned together (Menu option
`Tag-&gt;Tag flat sides' is helpful in this regard, see Section 7.3.2) and then
select menu option `Lights and Textures -&gt;align textures'. Devil then aligns
the textures adjoining the current side with the textures on neighboring,
tagged sides. `Neighboring side' means that the two sides share a common line.
The sides which have their textures aligned will have their tagging removed.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading71">6.4 OVERLAYING OTHER TEXTURES</A></h2>

Translators Notes: <p>
*	Avoid specifying a texture for Texture-2 which completely covers the texture
specified for Texture-1 because this simply means wasted double texture mapping
in Descent.<p>
*	When you bring up a texture selection list, Devil will only display the
"normal" textures for that type, such as grates and lights for Texture-2. You
can specify non-standard textures (e.g., a Texture-2 texture for Texture-1 and
visa-versa) but you will need to note the texture number in the appropriate
list (Texture-1, Texture-2, Animation or Thing) and then type this code
directly into the applicable texture box.<p>
The only time you are likely to want to do this is if you want a different
effect, like having other "normal" textures move in Descent 2. You will still
get the sounds made by the moving Texture-1 if you use a water or lava texture
but you can control the rate of movement to a degree. You may also have to
adjust the lighting accordingly as lava is a <i>very </i>bright light source.
If you want your texture to move without the accompanying sound-effects you
should use the "moving bar" texture (349), but you cannot control the rate of
movement and your texture will tend to scroll diagonally, and if you align it
so that the bar texture flows straight, your texture will also be aligned in
that direction.<p>
*	Another use of normal-looking Texture-2 overlaying an "active" Texture-1 is
to surprise the player. Rock21 (0)over Lava02 (378) will still damage the
players shields and explode if shot at ... it just <i>looks</i> safe ;-).  In
Descent 2 you can create "bouncing wall" sections by setting Texture-1 to the
Force01 (420) or Force02 (432), expanding that to the size of a complete side
and then hiding it behind an innocuous Texture-1. Shots and ships will be
repelled from this side when they touch it. Unfortunately you will still hear
the force-field hum when you are in the vacinity of this section. The texture
used for Texture-2 will also be stretched, so if it needs to look normal, you
can either assume that most shots will bounce off the force-field anyway or
create a very thin cube on the side (0.1 units wide) and place the force field
on this. You can then insert a Wall (type = illusion) in the Connection and
place your normal Texture-1 and Texture-2 on that. A drawback of this method is
that if the cube is very thin, the effect of the force-field extends beyond the
wall, so that you achieve a shootable Texture-2 which is "protected"by a force
field. (The monitor in the red-key section of the shared secret skeleton level
example is built this way) Interestingly, sides having lava as Texture-1 and a
force-field as Texture-2 evidence similar effects ... you will get the
explosion if you shoot at it, not the force-field bounce.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading72">6.4.1 WORKING WITH ANIMATED TEXTURES</A></h3>

Translators Notes:<p>
*	The animation sequences for doors, normally a second texture, do not appear
in the lists for Texture-1 or Texture-2, but under the Animation list in the
Wall mode window.<p>
*	You may specify a position in an animation sequence other than the default
closed position but you will need to enter the texture number manually ...
increasing the texture number by one to display the next frame in the sequence.
The number of frames in the sequence varies for each door type but the final,
completely open frame is normally between 7 and 11 frames further on.<p>
*	By specifying the final frame as the second texture for a side you are then
able to align the door texture using the texture align dialog without having to
launch Descent to see what the door will look like when open.<p>
*	If you leave this frame as the second texture when the level is played,
however, the door will remain "stuck" in that open position until the player
passes through it correctly - although you will be able to see through it and
can shoot through it. The closed door texture on the reverse side is
unaffected, giving you the ability to shoot through a closed door without
enemies on that side being able to see you. (and they are then totally
embarrassed to be dead suddenly ).<p>
*	If you move a Thing near to or into the Connection of a Wall it will look
like the object is just in front of the door, but if you shoot the door open,
it will not close again afterwards as the object is in the way.<p>
*	You may hide a door behind a normal texture by first inserting the Wall and
then changing the texture in Side mode, specifying the texture you want as
Texture-1 and Nothing (0) as Texture-2. This trick only covers the door until
it is first opened - the normal door textures will be displayed afterwards.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading73">6.4.2 OTHER TEXTURE NOTES</A></h3>

Translators Notes:<p>
*	The lava fall textures in Descent 1 do not damage the players shields, but
those in Descent 2 will. The faster a player can fly through this Connection,
the less shield damage is done.<p>
*	The delivered shootable light textures are Ceil024 (291), Ceil025 (293),
Ceil028 (296) and Ceil029 (298). The blown versions of these lights is one
number higher.<p>
*	There is a difference between Nothing (0) and Empty (302), the latter will
usually produce the HOM effect when used as Texture-2.
