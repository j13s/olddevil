<h2>
<A NAME="Heading75">7.1 EDIT MENU</A></h2>


<h3>
<A NAME="Heading76">7.1.1 DELETE SPECIAL</A></h3>

This
function is discussed in Section 5.2.3

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading77">7.1.2  STRETCH AND SHRINK</A></h3>

With these two functions you can stretch or shrink the tagged objects in Cube
or Side mode about their common mid-points. The factor with which the object is
enlarged, can be changed in the Internal menu, it goes under the name `Enlarge
*'. This function naturally makes no sense in the other modes.<p>
Translators Note:<p>
When the grid is on, the Points will be set to a point on the grid. If your
enlarge factor is too similar to the grid-size, then you may find that `nothing
happens' when you select enlarge or shrink.  Turn the grid off in this case.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading78">7.1.3 MAKE STANDARD SIDE</A></h3>

When you select this menu option, Devil attempts to convert all tagged sides
into `standard form', i.e., to manipulate them so that they form cubes with
side-lengths of 20. The side is distorted `as little as possible', i.e. no
unnecessary rotation or anything similar is done, the outcome of which should
be quite intuitive.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading79">7.1.4 MAKE EDGE CO-PLANAR</A></h3>

This function enables you to avoid texture "beating" by making a side which has
one tagged edge co-planar. This is done by moving the tagged edge into the
plane of the other three edges.<p>


<h3>
<A NAME="Heading80">7.1.5 MAKE ROOM</A></h3>

This function is useful if you want to build a room out many different cubes.
It can be quite tedious to join all the cubes individually. This function
attempts to join all six sides of each tagged cube with a side which is in the
vicinity, in the same way as if you clicked on `Delete' in the Side window.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading81">7.1.6 SPLIT CUBE</A></h3>

With this function you can split the current cube into seven smaller cubes
without changing anything else except the current cube. To do this, Devil
initially inserts a cube into the middle of the original, which is the same
shape as the original but is half its size, and then adds six additional cubes
on all sides of that cube, so that the space occupied by the original cube is
filled.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading82">7.1.7 CORRIDOR WIZARD</A></h3>

The Corridor-wizard is provided to create curved and elliptical corridors with
any number of cubes in its cross section. When the Corridor-wizard is initially
invoked, a standard corridor is produced on the current side if this is not
already joined to another side. The corridor which is open in the corridor
control window at the time is depicted in brown in the level instead of gray.
In the corridor you normally find one or more yellow markers with which you can
change the shape of the corridor. In addition, the corridor control window is
displayed. Use `OK' to accept the corridor into the level or `Cancel' to delete
the corridor without making it a permanent part of the level. With `Type' you
choose which sort of corridor you want to make:<p>
*	Polynom: This is a curved or twisted corridor.<p>
*	Straight: Simply a straight corridor.<p>
*	Ellipse: A corridor in the form of an ellipse<p>
The `Cubesize' field allows you to specify how long each cube segment should
be.<p>
All types of corridors also work with multiple sides as the starting side,
i.e., if you tag multiple, neighboring (flat) sides and start the
Corridor-wizard with one of these sides as the current side, the initial
cross-sectional surface of the corridor consists of the current and the tagged
sides.<p>
Translators Note:<p>
Despite the above, the Corridor-wizard does not consider cube sides in the
cross-section that are on the other side of a solid wall to the current cube.
In order to produce a corridor using this shape as a base, you must join all
the cubes before invoking the corridor wizard ... you can always insert the
sides again afterwards. The corridor wizard also honors the settings for
convex/weird, so if you find that a corridor seem to stop before it should, it
could be that cubes in the next segment would have been non-convex.

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading83">7.1.7.1 Corridor-wizard: Polynom</A></h4>

In this mode the corridor is "guided" by the yellow markers which indicate the
direction that the corridor originated from. Marker movement works just as with
Thing movement. Control:	A spline is made to fit a curve between the two
markers so that the marker 			direction is the direction of the corridor at the
marker.<p>
		Moving the markers closer together reduces the number of cubes. (min. 3)<p>
In the control window there are also three additional controls:<p>
*	Insert/Delete: With these controls, additional Markers can be inserted in (or
deleted from) the corridor in order to be able to change the shape of the
corridor more easily.<p>
*	`Connect End': With this control, the end of the corridor is joined to the
current side (which may not always be possible) and then it can only be
manipulated using the remaining markers in the rest of the corridor.

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading84">7.1.7.2 Corridor-wizard: Straight</A></h4>

In this mode a single, straight corridor is produced. For this reason a marker
is only provided at the end of the corridor.<p>
Control:	Just a straight line between the base and end marker.<p>
		Moving the marker closer to the base reduces the number of cubes. (Min 3)

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading85">7.1.7.3 Corridor-wizard: Ellipse</A></h4>

In this mode an ellipse is produced. It has two markers, the one determines the
larger, the other the smaller radius.<p>
Control:	An ellipse using one marker to indicate the large radius<p>
		and a second for the small radius.<p>
		Moving the markers closer together reduces the number of cubes.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading86">7.1.8 SET CONNECTION SIDE/EXIT</A></h3>

This function allows you to mark a side in the level as End or Connection-side.
It was especially important in earlier versions of Descent 1 which were
inclined to abend when loading the level if this side was not defined. This
side is used, in the case of creating Descent 1 levels, as the exit to the
ending corridor. In order to have Descent generate the exit sequence (where it
steers your Pyro through the corridor) you will need a briefing (.txb) file to
be added to your .hog by a program other than Devil. This feature is also not
relevant to Descent 2 levels as the ending corridor is not flown through with
external missions. When inserting a level into another, this side becomes the
Connection, see Section 5.1.2. about this.<p>
<p>
Translators Note:<p>
*	You do not need to declare this exit in Descent 2 as transition to the next
level will still work correctly without it, but you should still ensure that it
cannot be seen (hide it around a bend etc.) because this side will exhibit the
well-known "Hall Of Mirrors" effect.<p>
*	Although you cannot provide your own exit sequences in Descent 2 (1.2), you
can have the cut-scenes from the CD played by replacing the reactor with one of
the Big-Boss robots which appeared in the last level for each planet.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading87">7.1.9 ENTER DATA</A></h3>

With this menu option you can change Descent data directly in a most
uncomfortable fashion. It is actually meant for test purposes and should not
used. This feature is useless unless you know the exact offsets and lengths of
the data you want to change. Unless you know what you're doing, you'll probably
just cause Devil to crash.<p>


<h2>
<A NAME="Heading88">7.2  LIGHTS AND TEXTURES MENU</A></h2>

As from the 2.2L release of Devil, the lighting has been re-worked to such a
degree that levels illuminated previously may not display too well in the
rendering mode, although they will still display correctly under Descent. In
such cases it may be adviseable to illuminate the complete mine again, as this
is also required for the "Adjust Light"option to work

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading89">7.2.1 RECALCULATE TEXTURES</A></h3>

If this menu option is selected, the Outlines of all tagged sides are
recalculated unless they are protected against this via the special "locked
side" tagging. This function is useful supposing you had protected a side
against recalculation but its Outline has since changed and now you want the
side to be recalculated or if you inserted a group and changed the scale -
Devil does not automatically recalculates the textures in this case.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading90">7.2.2 ALIGN TEXTURES</A></h3>

This option is discussed in Section  6.3.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading91">7.2.3 MINE ILLUMINATING.</A></h3>

This function is very useful. The way it works is quite simple (to program it
was, by contrast, quite tricky): All lighting values (i.e., those for the Edges
and those for inner-cube light) are calculated and set according to the lights
distributed in the level. It works as follows; all cubes in which the
illumination should be re-calculated, must be tagged and then the menu option
`Lights and Textures -&gt; illuminate mine' must be selected. Devil then
processes for a while (the program shows how far it is because it can take
quite a few minutes with a 486DX2-66 and a large level) and all light values in
the tagged cubes are reset. If you only want to change the value for the Edges
(and not the inner-cube light), use the menu option `Lights and Textures
-&gt;set edge light'. If you only want to calculate the value for the
inner-cube light, use `Lights and Textures -&gt; set inner cube light'. With
the latter it should be noted that the calculation is done following the
Edge-light settings and is therefore dependent on the light sources existing in
the level.<p>
A sudden transition from light to dark can be avoided during calculation if you
select the `Lights and Textures' option `Set smooth edge light' instead of `Set
edge light'.<p>
The calculation of the Edge-lighting is influenced by the following
parameters:<p>
*	In the Internal window: `Quarterway'. This is the distance that light still
travels once the intensity is reduced by a quarter. An increase in this values
results in light-sources which have a longer range (i.e. it doesn't fade a lot
close up, but only further away).<p>
*	In the Internal window: `Brightness'. This is simply the factor which all of
the strengths of the texture light-sources are multiplied by. An increase in
this value results in light-sources which are brighter (i.e., all of the
light-source illuminated Edges are brighter by the same factor, those which are
relatively near and those that are far way).<p>
*	In the light-source file (Standard files are `default.ls1' for Descent 1 and
`default.ls2' for Descent 2): Each texture which is a light-source has a
brightness value specified here. The texture divided into 2*2=4 sections in
which the light can be specified individually. The light-source file to be used
can be changed with the menu option `Change lightsource file'.<p>
Devil goes about level-illumination as follows: Each Side is checked against
the table in the light-source file to see whether the texture is a light-source
or not. If it is, then Devil places "light-sources" onto the side and
calculates their effect. To do so, the texture is divided in four sections and
placed like that on the Side as it would appear later in Descent. <p>
The four sections of each bitmap in the side are "replaced" with light sources;
the intensity of these light sources are modified only if a part of the section
lies on the side. The effect of each light source is then calculated and the
light on the edges is set in an appropriate way to simulate these light
effects. The light dispersion is also "smoothed" afterwards in order to avoid
having abrupt changes of light on (nearly) flat walls.

<h4>
<A NAME="Heading92">7.2.3.1 The Adjust Light" option</A></h4>

Previous versions of Devil did not save information about lightsources which do
not change during the game when the .RL2-file was `written. This version saves
the full information by default, unless the File menu option `save level
without full light information' is used. (This option is useful if you
experience difficulties with very large levels containing many lightsources due
to the Descent limits on the number of lightsources. If this work-around is not
sufficient, then please e-mail the DDL with details, although I don't think it
is really necessary as the 500 lightsources and 10000 changed corners should be
). Saving full light information will result in slightly larger levels<p>
The `Adjust Light' button will only be active once the level has been
illuminated with this version of Devil, and then only if the current side
contains a recognized lightsource. This feature is only really useful when one
of the rendering modes is on as it displays the results of your additional,
manual adjustment of the lighting. If this button is pressed, all lightsources
except the one on the current side are turned off and you can manually adjust
the light from this specific lightsource alone by changing the light values of
the edges. Once you have done this, click on the 'Adjust light' button with the
left mouse-button to save your changes or with the right mouse-button to cancel
your changes. In both cases the other lightsources will be turned on again. (If
you press the 'Adjust light' button in a level which doesn't have full light
information, 'the turning on' of the other lightsources will produce incorrect
results.)<p>
If the lightsource has a F.L. mask assigned to it, making it a blinking light,
then this effect will be simulated if you click the right mouse-button in the
level window. (The Move&amp;Display option `Flickering lights' in the Internal
menu must be selected). A message will be displayed if the frame-rate would
drop below the fastest displayable flickering light; you can easily test this
if you set the timer for a lightsource to 0.01. If your system is not powerful
enough to display as many frames as are needed for the light (e.g. you need at
least 10 frames per second to display a blinking light with mask 10 and timer
0.1), you can "stretch" the time-scale using the Internal menu option. (e.g. if
you specify a value 2.0 in 'Stretch time', a light which will blink every 1/10
second in Descent, will blink every 1/5 second in Devil). I would expect a
frame-rate at about 10 frames on a normal system (Pentium 133, a window with
480*480). You can speed up the whole thing a lot if you use smaller windows to
display the level (this is due to the slow copying routines of the grx-library
which are not that easy to avoid because I need the rest of the library).<p>


<h3>
<A NAME="Heading93">7.2.4 SET INNER CUBE LIGHT</A></h3>

The value of the inner light of all tagged cubes is set according to the
average edge light value of the cubes, which is useful if you wish to manually
adjust a section without re-illuminating the whole mine. The cubes will be
untagged on completion. This function is also discussed in Section 4.2<p>


<h2>
<A NAME="Heading94">7.3 TAG</A></h2>


<h3>
<A NAME="Heading95">7.3.1 THE TAGGING-FILTER</A></h3>

This
little-known function is actually quite useful: If you press `Ctrl' and click
the left mouse-button on any of the buttons in the Cube, Side, Thing or Wall
windows which can be regarded as "type" buttons, then all objects of the same
"type" as that button will be tagged (e.g. Txt1 and Txt2 in the Side window).
If you do the same with the right mouse-button, all objects with the same type
will be untagged (not available with all fields).<p>
This function also works with the textures in the texture list displays.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading96">7.3.2 TAG/UNTAG SPECIAL</A></h3>

Sides can be locked with this option. With Edges, all three edges of a corner
in a cube are tagged. This does not function in other modes.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading97">7.3.3 TAG FLAT SIDES</A></h3>

With this menu option, all `flat' sides attached to the current side and all
marked sides can be tagged. Flat is taken to mean that the angle between the
two adjacent sides is less than that indicated in the Internal menu under `Tag
flat sides'.<p>
Sides currently tagged will not be untagged first, making this an `add'
operation. Sides considered `flat' to any tagged side will be tagged as well,
not only those considered `flat' to the current side.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading98">7.3.4 USE CUBE TAG</A></h3>

See Section 1.4 for a discussion about this option.<p>
In Side mode:	All sides of tagged cubes will be tagged.<p>
In Edge mode:	All edges of tagged tagged cubes will be tagged.<p>
In Point mode:	All points of tagged cubes will be tagged.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading99">7.3.5 USE SIDE TAG</A></h3>

Same as above, but only for Edges and Points of course.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading100">7.3.6 USE POINT TAG</A></h3>

Same as above, but only for Edges.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading101">7.4 THE MISSION MANAGER</A></h2>

The Mission Manager (`File-&gt;Mission Manager') is used to create complete
missions for Descent, i.e., to compile multiple levels together, insert secret
levels etc. All levels which are present in the current directory are displayed
in the right hand window panel, while the left hand window panel display
contains the names of the levels and the sequence in which they will be played
when they are saved as one mission (presented for selection under Load Mission
in Descent) when `save hog file' is selected.<p>
The Mission Manager does not cater for the insertion of all the various
newly-defined files in Descent; if you want to change the textures in Descent
for example, you will have to a different program than Devil for this (check
the link on the title-page and Section 7.5 )<p>
You can mark multiple levels in both the right and the left list; either by
selecting them individually or by using a wildcard (e.g. `*') in the text field
above the list. Devil does not respect the dot, i.e. `*.*' is not required, `*'
suffices to mark all the levels.<p>
With the Button `Open hog file' you can open a Hog file. The list of levels in
this Hog file then appears in the left hand display.<p>
Using the Buttons `-&gt;' and `&lt;-` you can add/remove levels into/out of the
displayed sequence. When adding, a level must first be marked on the right hand
side before it can be inserted on the left hand side or if no level is marked,
before the first secret level can be added to the end. To insert a level in a
particular position in the sequence, tag the level above which you want the new
level to be added.<p>
Removing a level from the list with the `-&gt;' button does not delete the
saved level from disk. If you delete a level which has been marked as having a
secret exit then the corresponding secret level will be converted back to a
normal level.. In this case you will have to remove the secret level as well
before re-adding because a secret level can only be declared when it is
inserted.<p>
With the Button `&lt;-Secret:' you can insert a secret level into the mission.
The level number (simply counted from the top of the list on the left) which
contains a Wall of the `Secret exit' type, must be specified in the `Secret'
field (complete the entry by pressing Enter). The level receives a special
indicator in the left hand list (namely the number of the level with the secret
exit behind the level name) and is automatically placed at the bottom of the
list.<p>
With the button `Extract levels' you can copy single or multiple levels out of
a Hog file and [place them into the directory specified on the right hand side
panel. You can then load them into Devil, which is particularly useful in order
to get to the original Descent levels, for which you simply open the Hog file
`descent.hog' in the Descent directory. Data pertaining to secret levels is not
available in this file, however, but you can identify certain of the Descent 2
secret levels by their `-S.RL2' suffix.<p>
Under `Mission name:' you specify the name of the mission. This you must
provide because otherwise Descent will not display the mission. With `Anarchy
Level' you can set the type of mission to `Anarchy', i.e., it only appears in
Descent when a multi-player game is started.<p>
With `Save hog file' you can save the mission. When playing the mission in
Descent, the levels are played in sequence as they are displayed on the left
hand side (An exception is with Secret levels - if the player enters in this
level and then leaves it again, in Descent 1 the level following the one with
the secret exit is played, in Descent 2 the player returns to the level in
which the `secret exit' was placed).

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading102">7.4.1 SHARED SECRET LEVELS</A></h3>

Translators Note: <p>
The Mission Manager does not need to support shared secret levels directly. If
you add the same secret level (by name) for different levels, it will be loaded
into the HOG-file multiple times, which is not necessary unless you want the
level to be reloaded so that you have to restart the secret level each time or
if you want to have that level available after an intervening secret level is
played, in which case it must be reloaded again.<p>
Descent 2 allows a single copy of a secret level to be accessed by multiple
normal levels, meaning that the status of the secret level is retained across
multiple accesses. This is achieved by fact that if a level has a secret exit
specified, and does not have it's own specific level listed, then the previous
secret level is presented again.<p>
In the following example, a number of levels were created, each with a "secret
exit". The .MN2 file was built with the Mission Manager and only one copy of
each secret level was added to the HOG-file. The secret level accessed from
FIRST is SOLO. The next four levels all access the same copy of SHARED. Finally
LASTONE accesses LONER.<p>

homepage.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading103">7.5 DEVIL AND POG-FILES (CUSTOM TEXTURES IN DESCENT)</A></h2>

POG-files are used to contain any user-defined textures for Descent. Devil
cannot be used to compile POG-files, but other such programs do exist and are
referenced in the WWW-site indicated on the title-page. Devil can, however,
read POG-files; although the Mission Manager does not (yet) cater for
POG-files, even if they are present in the Hog -file.<p>
Use the "Change pogfile" button in the Buttons display to specify which
POG-file to use.<p>
You can have only one POG-file active at any time in Devil (I don't think you
need more, do you?). If no POG-file is selected and a level is loaded, Devil
checks the directory where you loaded the previous .POG-file from for a file
with the same name as the level, but which has a .POG suffix.. If found, it is
automatically loaded if no POG-file is currently loaded.<p>
If you want to "unload" a POG-file, select the "Change pogfile" button and then
select `cancel' in the file dialog.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading104">7.6 THE INTERNAL-WINDOW</A></h2>

The `Internal' window allows various parameters to be specified which are used
during of the operation of Devil. The uppermost button in the window (Group)
serves to switch between the various areas:

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading105">7.6.1 MOVE &amp; DISPLAY</A></h3>

*	Visibility: All objects within this range of vision will be displayed.<p>
*	Moving you:  "Step-size" to use when changing the current position.<p>
*	Turning you:  Angle of turn in degrees when changing the current view
direction.<p>
*	Flip y-axis:  Reverse the up/down keys.<p>
*	Mouse: Flip axis:  Select which mouse axis to flip (x, y or z)<p>
*	Dclick: Amount of time for a double-click.<p>
*	Perspective: Single/Double - Perspective of a level. In Double-perspective
only the first two rendering modes work.<p>
*	Rendering: Specifying the texture mode:<p>
-	Off: No textures are displayed at all.<p>
-	Only current cube: Only textures in the current cube will be displayed.<p>
-	On: If you are inside a cube, you will see the normal Descent view. If you
find yourself outside the mine, textures of the current cube and all cubes
visible from it are displayed.<p>
-	On with collision: The same as `On', only Devil attempts to prevent the
player from flying out of the mine. `Attempts', as the routine still does not
work completely faultlessly.<p>
It can happen in both of the latter modes, that you are suddenly faced with a
black screen after passing through a cube boundary because Devil did not detect
the crossing of the boundary properly. To re-initialize the graphics, you
simply press Ctrl+Shift+Space.<p>
*	Flickering Lights: Displays blinking lights when adjusting a side. See
Section 7.2.3.1<p>
*	Stretch Time: Adjust blinking light for slower machines. See Section
7.2.3.1<p>
*	Gamma corr.: With this value you can change the screen brightness (for
texture mapping).<br>This is useful to match the Devil displays to your Descent
brightness setting.<p>
*	Co-ord. axis: Display the co-ordinate axis in the various perspectives. In
double perspective, the co-ordinate axis is exactly in the intersection of the
two view directions.<p>
The co-ordinate axis displayed is always the same size and is merely intended
as a reference. The blue line indicates the direction you will face if you
align yourself to the positive z-axis, the green line indicates the same for
positive x-axis and the brown line for the positive y-axis.<p>
*	Display what: Here you can specify which things should be displayed by
Devil:<p>
-	Wireframe: Determines whether all cubes (making up the mine) are drawn or
not. The on/off settings apply when texture rendering is on and can be toggled
using Shift+Tab.<p>
-	All Lines: If you turn this option on, you get a map which is similar to the
Automap shown in Descent. This display method only works temporarily (until the
structure of the mine is changed) and is automatically turned off if it is not
working properly anymore. You can toggle this mode with F5.<p>
-	Things: Draw/don't draw Things.<p>
-	Walls: Draw/don't draw Walls.<p>
-	Extra Markers: Additional lines (cube side-tags) when a cube is tagged.
Useful when you have a large room and cannot see whether an inner cube is
tagged or not.<p>
-	Group Preview: This option is provided to reduce the amount of confusion with
adding groups. If the option is turned on and there is a group with a defined
Connection side in the "Group:" field in the cube window, then the first cube
of this group is displayed in brown in the position where it would be inserted
if you press 'Insert'. Connected sides of the first cube of the group are
marked with the usual side markers (if the first cube is symmetric but the
attached macro is not). Use Edge-mode cycling ("e") to change the orientation.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading106">7.6.2 TEXTURES &amp; ILLUM.</A></h3>

*	Tag flat sides: The maximum angle permissible between two sides for them to
be accepted as `flat' and then tagged when `Tag-&gt;Flat sides' is used (see
Section 7.3.2)<p>
*	Stretch bitmap: The factor by which textures are stretched.<p>
*	Quarterway: After this distance, the light intensity (from a light-emitting
texture) is reduced by a quarter during automatic level-illumination.<p>
*	Brightness: The factor by which all light-sources are multiplied during
automatic level-illumination.<p>
*	Min. light: The minimum value which an Edge may be set to during automatic
level-illumination.<p>
*	Little bulbs: If turned on, this option displays a yellow light-bulb symbol
in the lower left-hand corner of lightsource textures in the texture lists.
Textures which can be shot out also have a white broken-bulb symbol in the
lower right corner.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading107">7.6.3  MODIFY</A></h3>

*	Moving obj. : Step-size when moving an object.<p>
*	Turning obj. : Angle of turn when changing an object.<p>
*	Gridsize : When points are moved, they will be forced to a point on (an
imaginary) grid of this size if it is switched on. This value applies to all
three spacial directions.<p>
*	Grid : Toggle grid on/off..<p>
*	Conn. dist. : Maximum distance allowed between points for them to be joined
during the normal cube-joining process.<p>
*	Uconn. dist. : Maximum distance allowed between points when joining two cubes
when one side is tagged and the other is the current side.<p>
*	Enlarge * : Factor by which an object is enlarged/reduced.<p>
*	Draw orig. lines : If this option is on, then the original positions of the
lines are drawn in yellow when you move a point, side or cube. This option only
affect wire-frame mode.

<h3>
<A NAME="Heading108">7.6.4 WARNINGS</A></h3>

*	Ask del one: Warn when deleting a single object.<p>
*	Ask del tagged: Warn when deleting tagged objects.<p>
*	Convex/Weird: Warn when cubes are convex/twisted.<p>
*	Grid &amp; Rotate: When turning cubes, warn if the grid is on (in order that
the cube does not become unintentionally twisted).<p>
*	Double keys: Warn during a save if a key appears twice.<p>
*	2 reactors/flags: Warn during save if a reactor or (with Descent 2) a Flag is
duplicated.<p>
*	Thing o.o.B.: Warn during save if a Thing is not inside the level.<p>
*	Illum. save warning: Warn if level lighting must be re-calculated.<p>
*	Too fast fl. lights:. Warn if blinking light timer is too fast for Devil to
display properly.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading109">7.7 INFO</A></h2>

*	Level info: Provides short statistics about the level: How many Things,
Robots, Cubes, an overview of the Player-starts etc.<p>
*	Devil Info: How to obtain the latest release of the editor, copyright
blah-blah etc.<p>
*	Keys: Displays a list of the `hotkeys'.
