<h2>
<A NAME="Heading15">2.1 THE WINDOW</A></h2>

Each
window in Devil consists of the actual window content and the title-bar, which
is made-up of two click-able buttons: a smaller square one on the left and a
longer rectangular one on the right which contains the window title. In most
windows, these buttons have the following functions:<p>
*	Left mouse-button on left button: Close the window.<p>
*	Right mouse-button on left button: Minimize the window to the height of the
title-bar, if the window is already minimized, restore it to its previous
size.<p>
*	Left mouse-button on right button: Move the window.<p>
*	Right mouse-button on right button: Enlarge/reduce the window.<p>
A window can be brought to the foreground simply by clicking on it.<p>
You can switch between levels currently loaded in memory using the `Level'
button in the `Buttons' display.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading16">2.2 THE MENUBAR</A></h2>

The Menubar at the top edge of the screen contains many of the available Devil
functions, which would otherwise only be reachable via the keyboard. In order
to select a menu option, click on the corresponding menu title and, holding the
left mouse button pressed, move the mouse pointer to the desired option and
release it.  Menu options which are suffixed with `&gt;' indicate sub-menus
which are displayed when the menu option is selected.<p>
Using the keyboard, the menus can be reached by pressing `Alt+letter', where
letter is the one underlined in the menu name. Thereafter, the individual
sub-menus or menu options can be reached by pressing the underlined letter or
by moving the cursor up/down.  Select the option by pressing `Enter'.<p>
At the right-hand side of the menubar is the name of the level which is
currently being edited.

<h2>
<A NAME="Heading17">2.3 THE MENU OPTIONS</A></h2>

Menu options can be selected with the left or right mouse-button, which makes a
difference with almost all functions. If an option is shaded, it is
de-activated and cannot be selected.<p>
Using the keyboard, options can be selected via cursor left/right within a
window (the current window-field is red-framed). In this case `Enter' simulates
the left mouse-button and `Shift+Enter' the right. It is only possible to
change between the main mode windows via the keyboard (see also Section 4).<p>
Sometimes two special pop-up dialogue buttons are also displayed:<p>
*	The "List button" (as with Load and Save): The List box displays a collection
of words (e.g. filenames) sorted alphabetically in descending order. An item
can be selected with `Enter', and you can initially choose the file name with
the cursor, left/right and `Home' and `End' keys. If the list is very long,
pressing the initial letter of the desired word places you at the first word in
the list starting with that letter. Pressing `Enter' selects that corresponding
word. By pressing `Esc' you can undo the choice of a word.<p>
Translators Note:<p>
This level-loading example shows why using a mouse is easier ;-) :<p>
`Alt+F', L to load, press cursor-down four time to move the red frame to the
level names, then press Enter to "activate" the list of names.  Now press `y'
to get to the levels starting with `y'. Move the box with the up/down cursor
keys to get to YELLOW3.RL2.  Press spacebar to select the level name.  Now
press cursor-up until the red-frame is back on the OK button.  Press Enter. <p>
*	The Text button: In a text input field there is a special function. You can,
after selecting the field, remove the contents of the field completely using
`Shift+Del' and otherwise move around normally with cursor keys etc. and enter
text. If you reach the right edge of the field, the text scrolls further to the
left.
