      I first intended to write a short documentation about building a small
      level with DEVIL but then I noticed that I should explain things more
      thoroughly. So I wrote 'DEVIL.DOC' (ok, you needn't read that first but 
      you should read it sometimes because not all functions are explained
      here). 
      I'll also write another level (without step-by-step documentation) to 
      show how producers and switches work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [A]. A LEVEL FROM THE SCRATCH

--[A1]------ Moving around
      
      To control your movements with your mouse just click on the arrows to 
      the right: left click is turn and right click is move. On the keyboard 
      the commands are (you have to switch the NUMLOCK ON):
        A/Y (perhaps Z ?)       forwards/backwards (sorry, german keyboard)
        1/3                     banking
        2/4/6/8                 turn around
        [SHIFT]+2/4/6/8         gliding
      IMPORTANT: when I refer to NUMLOCK ON or OFF, I assume that you change
      the Move/Modify-mode ONLY with your NUM-key.  
      If you want to move something else instead yourself you have to switch 
      the NUMLOCK OFF (or click on the button below the arrows). You can only
      move tagged objects. Normal objects are moved relative to your point of 
      view but things with orientation (starts, robots and the reactor) are
      steered (just lik you would fly them). Just try it.
      If you want to use your mouse, read the 'Your mouse and DEVIL' section
      in DEVIL.DOC.
      
--[A2]------ The modes

      You change modes by pressing [CONTROL] and the first letter of the mode 
      That would be '[C]+S' for side-mode, '[C]+P' for point-mode, .... You 
      will notice that every time you change the mode the display in the 
      upper right corner will change to display your possibilities of editing 
      the current object. The Internal menu is the most complicated: here you 
      can enter the move-factor, the angle of your turns when you press 
      2/4/6/8, ...
      Now go to cube-mode ('[C]+c'). Let's suppose you want to change the 
      light-level of this cube: just go to 'lights' using the cursor-keys and 
      press [RETURN].
      If you've chosen sth. wrong just press [ESC]. This will quit the 
      current menu. Now you may enter any value from 0000 to 8000 (hex). This 
      will change the light level in the whole cube. Sometimes it is 
      necessary to change the light level for each side seperately (e.g. when 
      there are lights on the ceiling). This is done in the side- or point-
      mode. If you want to go to another cube (well, if you'd have more than 
      one :) just press 'c' for the next or '[S]+c' for the previous cube. 
      That is 's' or '[S]+s' for sides, 't' or '[S]+t' for things, ... 
      When you change sides, you will always remain in the same cube; when 
      you change points you will remain in the same side.
      When you want to change several objects, e.g. the textures of all walls 
      in a level, you may find it handy to 'tag' objects. This is possible in 
      every mode by pressing '[SPACE]'. '[S]+[SPACE]' tags/untags every 
      object in the level.

--[A3]------ Macros and deleting

      OK, after you get used to the different controls let's try our first 
      macro. Go to side-mode ('[C]+s') and choose a side with the texture 
      'rock001'. Press '[S]+m' to make a macro (or use the pulldown-menus). 
      This macro consists of the current cube and all tagged objects 
      (including walls and things). To insert a macro press [INSERT] if you 
      want to keep the cubes seperate or '[S]+[INSERT]' if you want an 
      connection between the cubes. This is only possible in cube-mode, so 
      you better press '[C]+c'. Do this now (and since you want to fly 
      through this level you should use '[S]+[INS]' :). The inserted cube is 
      blue (that is: tagged). This is because it is very easy to make things 
      wrong with macros. So if you just inserted a macro and want to delete 
      it just press [DELETE]. This will delete every tagged object (hence the 
      name). You can't delete the active cube (which is shown green) so you
      will have to change the cube some-times before deleting it. Now compare 
      the cubes (especially concerning the lights, they should be on the same 
      side on both cubes). Most certainly you've made a mistake so that you 
      have to delete the cube. Now try it again while I'll try to explain 
      just HOW this damned macros work (I got it wrong some zillion times my-
      self). When you make a macro, DEVIL takes the current side and point. 
      When you insert a macro, DEVIL takes the current point and side and 
      tries to mend these with the point and the side of the macro. DEVIL 
      will therefore turn the cube in the macro to match the two points and 
      sides. Just keep trying until you get the hang of it. 
      Then build a corridor with an intersection (you may want to make longer 
      macros to build your corridor faster). Be sure to make one of the bran-
      ches very long, this branch will become the exit-corridor. After making
      it at least aprox. 10 cubes long, go to the last cube and switch to the
      finishing side. Then press [END] which will make the exit.
      It schould look like 'tut1.rdl'

--[A4]------ Textures

      Texture changing is easy: just switch to side-mode and choose texture 1 
      or 2. Texture 2 is used for signs, monitors or lights. It will lay on 
      texture 1. Some textures (like lava) are special. These are handled 
      automatically by DESCENT (it's a GREAT game). Change some textures and 
      notice that when you change texture 1, texture 2 (the lights) will 
      remain the same. You may want to change the orientation of the second
      texture: do that with 'change orientation'.

--[A5]------ Walls

         side        wall      side
            __________ __________
           |          |          |
           |          |          |
      void |  cube1   |  cube2   | void  
           |          |          |
           |__________|__________|

      Two adjacent cubes in the void: a wall is a cube-side between two cubes 
      a side is a cube-side without another adjacent cube. 
      Walls are sides between cubes. They may have different functions: 
      switches (for doors or producers), doors, only texture or just plain 
      nothing. A wall may even be a door AND a switch. 
      We will make two doors now:the first in the bent branch just after the 
      intersection (branch one) and the second in the other branch so that 
      there is just one cube left (branch two). Change to wall-mode and 
      change the side of the cube so that the side in which you want to 
      insert the door is red. Then press [INSERT]. Now let's change the types 
      of the doors: the door in branch one is 'stay open, switch' (means you 
      can't open it), 'open at end' (means it will open when the reactor is 
      blown up). In addition to that you should set the switch to 'normal 
      exit' (means exit). The second is 'open/close w. laser' and 'red key'.
      You are now at 'tut2.rdl'.

--[A6]------ Things
      
      Things are Robots/Items/Weapons. Switch to thing-mode and press 
      [INSERT]. An energy boost will appear (default). Switch him into a red 
      key using the upper right menu. If you put the red key behind the red 
      door you get 1000 points for intelligent behaviour: either delete it 
      (tag it first, but remember that you can't delete the active object) or 
      move it around (tag it and switch NUMLOCK OFF). Now go to the cube 
      behind the red door. Insert another thing and switch it to reactor. 
      Since the reactor is kind of special you have to change the cube-type 
      as well. Go into cube-mode and switch the cube-type to reactor.
      You may also want to insert a robot: insert another energy boost and
      change it's type to 'robot'. Now choose a robot and, if you want, an
      item that the robot will drop (drop-type 'drop item', choose item out
      of list and enter a drop-number)


--[A7]------ Exit

      The exit of a level is build a bit more complicated than in DOOM. First
      there is the exit-door: it never opens until the reactor is blown up.
      This wall is also a switch: when you pass it, the computer takes con-
      trol over your ship and steers it through the last corridor until the
      real exit is reached. Therefore an exit consists of 'stay open, switch'
      'open at end' and the switch 'normal exit'.
      The exit-side is the only side that is a wall (not quite right but it 
      should do). Therefore you should bend the corridor so that the exit
      wall can't be seen from the beginning of the exit-corridor (because of
      HOM-effects). I've not done so because it's only a stylistic fault and 
      won't do any harm.
      IMPORTANT: DESCENT seems to need an exit (we aren't 100% sure). When 
      you load a level without exit it will crash sometimes/sometimes not, 
      depending of the time, your age and the current moon-phase. This 
      freaked us a lot but we thinks we have sorted it out by now.
      The exit-corridor should also have a certain minimal length (try sth
      around 10 cubes at least) and it shouldn't have sharp corners (no 90ø 
      turns).
      Your level is now ready and should look like 'tut3.rdl'.

--[A8]------ Merging the level in DESCENT

      You don't have to merge them. Just only rename them in 'levelXX.rdl'
      where XX ranges from 01 to 27 including S1,S2,S3 (for secret levels).
      DESCENT will load this levels instead of those in the .HOG-file.

--[A9]------ Stylistics

      Here are just some tips what you should try to do/don't :
      - don't make the exit-corridor too short/straight (see exit)
      - insert the reactor in standard cubes so that they won't float (or
        steer them to the floor in a bigger room)
      - default texture for doors is rock001; you don't see it a lot but 
        change the texture to match adjacent textures 
      - ceiling (lights) and floor (tiles) should remain the same through the
        whole level
      - monitors and signs should be orientated in the same way
      - when you make a macro for public use, try to end it with a standard
        cube (reference point and side)
      - thank PARALLAX every day
      - be happy :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [B]. DEMO-LEVEL

      I'll just describe what you see when you fly through this level. First,
      there is a two-sided (means two different events, depending of your
      direction) switch for the producers. Then there is a energy-station
      (note: try to achieve a high 'wall-density' in energy-stations 'cause
      when you turn you see that the flocks in the air are just 2D). Next,
      another two-sided switch for two secret doors. The door to the left is
      'open/close w. switch' (means: it will close after some time), the 
      other is 'not normally opened' and will stay open when opened once via
      switch. First type is great for secret doors with goodies behind, second
      is for traps with robots. Then you'll pass a door and enter a BIG BALL
      (my first real macro :). This room  may be a bit slow on some machines 
      (mine for example). There will be another enemy and the reactor.
      Notice the mind-wheeling effect corridor <-> ball? 
      

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [C]. CHANGES 
      No more changes made.


I received lotsa mails asking about mouse-controlling or how to tag/untag ...
These things are explained more thoroughly in the DEVIL.DOC file and I won't
explain ALL subjects here. So if you got any questions remember: first RTFD,
then mail me. I will answer all questions if I explained some things poorly 
and if someone has suggestions for improvement, send them (thanx go to Pat
Johnson for suggesting how to improve the wall/side explanation).
Don't worry, be happy 
Boris
