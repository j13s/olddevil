			   Last Updated 12/11/95

	This document is a modified and updated version of Boris' original
	BUILDLEV.DOC, REFMAN.ODC, and DEVIL.DOC from DEVIL version 1.01.  
	Quite a bit of new info has been added, but if you look carefully, 
	you can still find many of Boris' original words.  In addition, be 
	aware that any references to "I", "me", or such, could be a reference 
	to Boris, Achim, or myself.  Please accept my apologies for any sleep 
	you might have lost worrying about it.

	A lot of changes have happened between version 1.2 and 2.0.  Please
	be patient as this document may not be 100% correct as I learn what
	features were moved, changed, added, or deleted.  Feel free to send

Part [*]. Introduction

	First, a guided tour of what you'll see in DEVIL.  The new 2.x
	versions of DEVIL are quite a bit different than the original 1.x
	versions, but in terms of functionality, it is pretty much the same.
	The big difference is in the user interface.

	At the top of the screen are the same Pull-Down menus that were 
	present before.  To the right of these menus is displayed the 
	title of the level (or macro) that is currently being edited.

	+----------------------------------------------+-------------------+
	|        Pull-Down Menus                       | Title of Level    |
	+----------------------------------------------+-------------------+

	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |

	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	|                                                                  |
	+------------------------------------------------------------------+

	Within the main editing window, everything has been broken down into
	individual windows that "float" in this area, and can be repositioned
	anywhere that is convenient for you.

	Each window has three parts:
	  - A small square in the upper-left corner acts as a sort of 
	    minimize/maximize button that either displays or turns off
	    the display of the main window contents (by clicking the right
	    mouse button).  It also acts as a close button (with the left 
	    mouse button), if it is a window that can be closed.
	  - Across the top (immediately to the right of the min/max box)
	    is the title of the window.  This is either the name of the
	    level or macro being edited, or the title of the special 
	    editing window (such as "Cube", "Side", or "Thing").
	    Clicking this with the left mouse button allows you to move the
	    window, while the right mouse button allows you to resize the
	    window.
	  - The main window, when displayed, shows all of the information
	    for the window.  For a level or macro, this is your view of
	    the level or macro itself.  For one of the object-editing windows,
	    this is the display of the current properties of the current
	    object of the specified type.

	When DEVIL 2.0 is first started the windows are as follows.  Each will
	be described in detail below:
	  - The largest window, occupying most of the screen, displays the
	    current level (or macro) being edited.
	  - To the right side of the screen, from top to bottom, are the
	    object editing windows:  Cube, Side, Point, Wall (Doors), Thing,
	    and Internal.
	  - The "Buttons" window is a special one that cannot be minimized.
	    It contains the buttons that you can click on to change your
	    point of view, change an object's location, and/or change an
	    object's orientation on the screen.  This window also allows you
	    to choose what you are modifying (i.e. a Side vs. Thing), or if
	    you are simply changing your point of view, or actually moving
	    an object.
	
	With DEVIL 2.0, you can edit more than one level at a time.  Each
	level appears in its own window.  Macros, as you load and create
	them, also appear in their own windows.  This allows you to make
	adjustments to macros on the fly, as well as the ability to 
	"cut and paste" between the windows (via creation and use of
	macros).  All operations are performed on the "current" editing
	window, which is indicated by an orange-colored border and header.

--[*1]------ The DEVIL Paradigm

	If you're reading this for the first time, you may be confused
	already.  Upon request from Georg Rehfeld, here's a brief 
	description of how DEVIL operates.

	DEVIL works on the concept of Cubes, Sides, Walls, Things, and
	Macros.  Everthing in a Descent level is a cube(*), and a level is
	simply a bunch of cubes stuck together with the sides of the cubes
	deleted to make rooms and corridors.  A side, for the purposes of
	DEVIL, is the side of a cube.  The side has a texture, and, when
	removed from adjoining cubes, allows the ship to fly from one
	cube to the next.  Walls is a general term for doors and switches
	that either open doors or activate producers.  Things are...what
	else?...things in a level such as robots, reactors, and power-ups.
	A macro is a DEVIL concept.  In DEVIL, a macro is simply a small
	collection of cubes, walls, and things that is saved and can be
	added to other levels.  In other words, they are little pieces of
	levels that you can create and use again and again.  All levels
	created with DEVIL must be created through at least one macro...
	namely the "CUBE1" macro, which is a macro composed of a single
	cube.  (Note: this is considered an "old" macro - a macro created
	in the old DEVIL 1.x format).

	A level is edited in DEVIL my moving yourself around in space around
	the wire-frame level you are creating.  You can change your 
	position, orientation, magnification factor, and other visibility
	factors while editing walls, points, sides, cubes, and things.

	(*) Trivia:  The developers at Parallax refer to cubes as "segments".

--[*2]------ The Pulldown Menus

	The pulldown menus are activated by pressing '[ALT]+highlighted 
	letter' (for mouse-users now and for ever: just click on the one you
	want).  The following is a list of the different menus and menu 
	items, which will be helpful later as a reference, but won't make
	much sense the first time you read this document.  Their full
	descriptions and explanations will be found throughout this document.
	  
	  * File
		- Load Level: To load a level for editing
		- Save Level: To save the current level
		- Play Level: To play the current level as it exists
		- Change Fullname: To change the actual name of the level
		  (or macro) that is being edited.
		- Quit: To exit DEVIL
	  * Move
		- Beam to Current: Repositions point of view to current object.
		- Goto Wall: Set the current cube and side to the cube and
		  side with the current wall.
		- Align to...: Reorients point of view along and towards the
		  selected axis.
		- Change to Sidecube:  If the current cube has a neighbor 
		  cube at the current side, select this neighbor cube as the
		  current cube.
	  * Edit
		- Insert: Inserts an object or macro.  
		- Fast Insert:  Inserts an object or macro.  If a macro,
		  the connecting side is automatically deleted to connect
		  the joining cubes.
		- Insert Special: Inserts the cubes and walls of the current
		  macro just as in 'Edit->Insert', but scale it with a given
		  factor.
		- Insert Special, Fast: Insert current macro like in 
		  'Edit->Special Insert', but scale it with a given factor.
		- Delete: Deletes currently tagged (selected) objects
		- Delete Tagged:  Delete all tagged objects in every mode. 
		  This is useful if you've inserted a macro the wrong way
		  because it deletes all things, walls, and cubes.  You are 
		  asked to confirm this decision.
		- Delete Special:  
		- Enlarge/Shrink: Zooms current view in or out
		- Make Room: Removes all common sides between tagged cubes
		  to create a single room out of them.  A common side is
		  found if all four points are within "ConnD" from the 
		  "Internal" menu.
		  This feature has been removed. You can replace it
		  with 'use cube tag' in side mode and pressing right
		  button on 'Delete' in the Side Window.
		- Set Exit: This allows you to set the exit side at the end
		  of the exit corridor.  The exit corridor starts with the
		  exit door and ends with the exit side (it's the corridor 
		  DESCENT steers your glider through at the end).
	  * Bitmaps and Lights
		- Recalculate Textures: See description in section titled
		  "Bitmap Manipulation".
		- Align Bitmaps: See description in section titled "Bitmap
		  Manipulation".
		- Light Shading: See description in section titled "Light".
	  * Macros
		- Make Macro: Creates a macro out of currently tagged cubes
		- Save Macro: Save the current macro to a file
		- Load Macro: Loads a macro from a file for use
		- Load Old Macro:  Loads an old .RMC macro file from the old
		  DEVIL 1.x versions.  (DEVIL now saves macros as .RDL files).
	  * Select
		- Tag Special: Only used in two modes:
		  * In point mode, tags all corners of the current point
		  * In side mode, you can lock this side.  This means the
		    texture of this side is not calculated anymore if the
		    shape of the side changes.
		- Use Cube Tag: In Side or Point mode, tags all sides/points
		  of the tagged cubes (other tags in this mode are cleared).
		- Use Side Tag: In Point mode, tags all points of the tagged
		  sides (other tags in this mode are cleared).
	  * Drawing
		- Each menu item toggles whether objects of that type are
		  currently displayed on the screen.  ('Drawing->X-tagged' is
		  for turning on/off the extra lines in tag mode)
	  * Info
		- Credits: Displays DEVIL credits and product information
		- Level Info: Displays statistics about the current level

--[*3]------ Keystrokes

	These hotkeys are available in every mode:

      [ESCAPE]                          end DEVIL (will prompt you to save
					  any unfinished work
      [SHIFT] + [ESCAPE]                end DEVIL IMMEDIATELY
      [SHIFT] + a/y                     increases/decreases sight
      [CONTROL] + c/s/w/t/i/p           changes mode
      [SHIFT] + c/s/w/t/p               previous cube/side/wall/thing/point
      c/s/w/t/p                         next cube/side/wall/thing/point
      NUMLOCK * /                       increase/decrease moving factor of 
					  yourself or of objects depending of
					  the current mode (move/modify)
      NUMLOCK +/-                       increase/decrease zooming
      NUMLOCK 9/7                       increase/decrease rotation angle
      g                                 switch grid ON/OFF
      [SHIFT] + m                       insert macro                       
      m                                 make macro
      [SPACE]                           tag untagged object or 
					 untag tagged object
      [SHIFT] + [SPACE]                 tag all objects if none are tagged or 
					 untag all objects if one is tagged
      [CONTROL] + key                   command only for current object,
					 ignore tagged objects
      [SHIFT] + key                     no side-effects 
      [SHIFT] + [DELETE]                delete all tagged objects (be careful                           
					with this one!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [A]. Moving and Looking Around

	The first thing about DEVIL you'll need to learn is how to move
	around and look at the object that you care about.  It's a little 
	tricky at first, but it gets easier the more you use it.

	The "Buttons" Window contains 6 buttons with 2 arrows on each button.

	+--------------------------------+
	| Buttons                        |
	+--------------------------------+
	| Modify What:                   |
	+--------------------------------+
	| Move Mode:                     |
	+----------+----------+----------+
	|     /    |    A     |     7    |
	|    L     |    I     |    /     |
	+----------+----------+----------+
	|          |    I     |          |
	|    <-    |    V     |    ->    |
	+----------+----------+----------+

	The Move Mode selector determines what is changed when you click on
	one of the arrow pushbuttons with one of the mouse buttons.  It has 
	three settings:
	  - Move You:  Arrows control the movement of yourself, and therefore
	    controls what you see in the editing windows.
	  - Move Object:  Arrows control position and orientation of the
	    current objects of the type listed next to "Modify What".
	  - Move Texture:  ???

--[A1]------ Using the Mouse

	With the Move Mode set to "Move You", your movement and 
	view is altered in the following ways, depending on which mouse
	button you use when you click on each of the six arrow buttons:

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Tilt nose DOWN          Slide Up
			     (view rotates up)       (view slides down)
	Down                 Tilt nose UP            Slide Down
			     (view rotates down)     (view slides up)
	Left                 Turn nose RIGHT         Slide Left
			     (view rotates left)     (view slides right)
	Right                Turn nose LEFT          Slide Right
			     (view rotates right)    (view slides left)
	Up/Right             Spin CLOCKWISE (view    Slide Forward
			     spins counter-wise)     (view "grows")
	Down/Left            Spin COUNTER-C-WISE     Slide Backward
			     (view spins clockwise)  (view "backs away")
	
--[A2]------ Using the Keyboard

	On the keyboard, the movement commands are:  (you have to switch 
	the NUMLOCK ON):

	A/Y (perhaps Z ?)       forwards/backwards (sorry, german keyboard)
	1/3                     banking
	2/4/6/8                 turn around
	[SHIFT]+2/4/6/8         gliding

	IMPORTANT: when I refer to NUMLOCK ON or OFF, I assume that you 
	change the Move/Modify-mode ONLY with your NUM-key. 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [B]. The Modes

	There are 6 different "modes" in DEVIL.  Each mode is used to add
	objects of different types, and to change the properties of 
	different types of objects.  Each of the 6 modes is described
	separately.  The current mode is now listed on the "Buttons" window
	as "Modify What".

	You change modes by pressing [CONTROL] and the first letter of the 
	mode that wish to be in.  Side mode would be '[C]+S', '[C]+P' for
	point-mode, and so on.  Changing modes this way will also automatically
	open the window that corresponds to the mode you are in. 

	Some actions act different in different modes, e.g. INSERT in cube-
	mode inserts a macro, in thing-mode a thing and in point-mode ....
	NO! Not a point. You can't insert points :). 

--[B1]------ Cube Mode

	Cube Mode allows you to change the properties of a cube as a whole,
	and to add or delete entire cubes.  Some properties include the 
	room type, inner lighting (previously called "cube lighting"), and
	average point lighting.

	For experienced WAD-builders: cubes are something like sectors (not
	quite right: while it was possible to divide a sector in parts that are
	not connected, this is not allowed with cubes). A cube has always eight 
	corners but you may arange these points (almost) as you want. You have
	to keep in mind:
	  * Cubes need to be convex. Well, what does that mean?  That means,
	    you can draw a line from every point inside the cube to every
	    other point and this line DOES NOT LEAVE THE CUBE. This is
	    important for DESCENT. Let me show you some examples:
	       ________                 __________        ___    ___
	      |        |                \        /        \  \  /  /
	      |        |                 \      /          \  \/  /
	  YES:|        |    CLOSE THING:  \    /      NO:   \    /
	      |        |                   \  /              \  /
	      |________|                    \/                \/

	    Luckily, DEVIL handles this thing automatically, so you won't have
	    to be bothered.
	  * Take a normal cube and push one corner inwards. This will not 
	    only make the cube 'lesser convex' but it will also bent the 
	    adjacent sides of the cube (try it for yourself). DESCENT has
	    problems with highly bent walls (e.g. the laserbolts won't 
	    collide with the wall) but DEVIL won't allow such walls and 
	    will refuse to move a point further.
	You don't have to think about wether or not this cube is allowed be-
	cause DEVIL does it for you (thanks, Achim!). I just mentioned these
	problems so that you can understand why DEVIL refuses to execute a 
	command.

	A "standard cube" is 20x20x20 in size.  The level "new.rdl" is an
	example of such a cube, as is the "cube1.rmc" old macro.

--[B2]------ Side Mode

	Side Mode allows you to change the properties of one particular 
	side of a cube.  Some properties include the texture(s) of the
	side, the orientation of the texture, and the average point lighting.

	A side has allways a texture, a wall may have a texture. Textures in
	DESCENT are a bit more 'powerful' than in DOOM (they are not only 
	textures). E.g. the lava-texture behaves like lava, this is only 
	because of the texture.

--[B3]------ Wall Mode

	Wall Mode allows you to change the properties of one particular 
	wall, and to add or delete walls.  Walls are sides that are shared
	by two cubes and can otherwise be called doors (which open and 
	close) or switches (which cause other things to happen).  Some 
	properties of walls include the wall type, the open/close 
	behavior, the key required, the objects it "activates" (if it's
	a switch), the hit points (how much does it have to be shot to
	destroy it), and the texture(s).

--[B4]------ Point Mode

	Point Mode allows you to change the properties of a particular
	point.  Some properties of a point include the X, Y, and Z co-
	ordinates, and the lighting.

--[B5]------ Thing Mode

	Things are everything else in the game that makes it fun.  Thing
	Mode allows you to change the properties of a thing.  There are
	several types of things:  items (like power-ups and weapons), 
	robots (the bad guys), hostages (the innocent victims), the start
	location(s), and the reactor.  Different things have different
	properties, so I won't mention them yet.

--[B6]------ Internal Mode

	Internal Mode allows you to change different behaviours of the
	DEVIL editor itself, such as how far to move something each time
	you click, how much to rotate an object, how much you can see, 
	and so on.  

	The properties that can be modified are:

	Property        Description
	-------------   -----------------------------------------------
	Visibility      How far into the distance you can see
	Move You        How far you move when you move
	Move Obj        How far an object is moved when you move one
	Turning You     Rotation angle when you turn yourself.
	Turning Obj     Rotation angle when you turn an object.
	Moving Bitmap    
	Turning Bitmap  
	Stretch Bitmap
	Grid Size       Size of the grid.  When "on", the grid forces points
			to exist on an angular grid.
	Grid            Toggles whether the grid is ON or OFF.
	Conn. Dist.     The maximum distance for two points when you try
			to connect them using 'Del' in side mode, or when you
			use "make room" feature.
	UConn. Dist     The maximum distance for two points when you try
			to connect them with while inserting a macro
	Ask del one     A safety feature.  When "on", DEVIL will ask for
			confirmation before deleting an item (by pressing
			the DELETE key).
	Ask del tagged  A safety feature.  When "on", DEVIL will ask for
			confirmation before deleting tagged items (by 
			pressing SHIFT-DELETE).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [C]. Selecting and Tagging

	DEVIL uses colors to illustrate the current cube, side, point, wall,
	and/or thing that is selected, as well as the cubes, sides, etc., 
	that are tagged.  In DEVIL, and object can be the "current"
	object (of which there can only be one), and can be one of several
	"tagged" (selected) objects.

	The current cube, wall, or thing is displayed in green.  The current
	point is shown by a 3-dimensional red "X".  The current side is 
	shown as a 4-sided polygon (typically a square) with one side 
	yellow, one side purple, and two red sides.  The yellow line 
	indicates the "top" of the side (as far as textures are concerned)
	and the purple side indicates the "left" of the side (as seen 
	while standing within the current cube).

	Choosing the current cube can be done in several ways:
	  - Using the mouse, click the left mouse button on a 
	    corner of the desired cube.
	  - Press 'c' to set the next cube (in numerical order) as the
	    current cube.  (or choose "Next Cube" from the pulldown)
	  - Press 'C' ('[S]+c') to set the previous cube (in numerical
	    order) as the current cube. (or choose "Previous Cube" from
	    the pulldown)
	  - Press '[C]+c' and type in the number of the cube you wish
	    to make current.  (or choose "Choose Cube" from the pulldown)

	Once the current cube has been chosen, the desired cube side
	can be made the current side in several ways:
	  - Press 's' to set the next cube side (in numerical order) as
	    the current cube side.
	  - Press 'S' ('[S]+s') to set the previous cube side (in 
	    numerical order) as the current cube side.

	With the current side chosen, the desired point can be made the 
	current in several ways:
	  - Using the mouse, click the left mouse button on the desired 
	    point.
	  - Press 'p' to set the next point (in numerical order) as
	    the current point on the current side.
	  - Press 'P' ('[S]+p') to set the previous point (in 
	    numerical order) as the current point on the current side.

	A handy feature exists to make current a cube that is next to your
	current cube.  With one side selected as current, pressing the '9'
	(zero) key will make the cube that is adjacent to the current cube
	via the current side the new current cube.

	Choosing the current wall can be done in several ways:
	  - Using the mouse, click the left mouse button on the
	    'X' that denotes the side of the wall you are interested
	    in while holding down the [C] (control) key.
	  - Press 'w' to set the next wall (in numerical order) as
	    the current wall. 
	  - Press 'W' ('[S]+w') to set the previous wall (in 
	    numerical order) as the current wall.

	Choosing the current thing can be done in several ways:
	  - Using the mouse, click the left mouse button on the
	    thing you are interested.
	  - Press 't' to set the next thing (in numerical order) as
	    the current thing.
	  - Press 'T' ('[S]+t') to set the previous thing (in 
	    numerical order) as the current thing.

	An object that is tagged is shown in blue.  Tagged sides are shown
	by a small blue "+" in the center of the side. (Note that one "leg"
	of the "+" is missing - this helps illustrate which side is actually
	tagged - nice touch, Achim).  For many of the operations
	in DEVIL, only those objects that are tagged will be affected by
	the chosen operation.

	The type of object tagged is the same as the current mode.  Thus,
	only cubes can be tagged while in cube mode, and so on. 

	There are many ways to tag objects, and some (as many as I've
	figured out how to use) are listed here:

	  - The current object is tagged/untagged by pressing the spacebar.
	  - '[S]+space' either untags all currently tagged objects, or 
	    tags all items of the specified type if none are tagged.
	  - A 2-D tag box is available by clicking with the right
	    mouse button while draggin wthe mouse.  A 2D box can 
	    then be drawn.  All objects within this 2D box (extending 
	    forward and backward to the limit of your visibility) will be
	    tagged.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [D]. Object Location and Orientation

	If you want to move something else instead yourself you have to 
	switch the NUMLOCK OFF (or click on the button below the arrows).
	Or, click on the "Move/Modify" button until the setting is 
	"Modify".  This allows you to move/rotate objects instead of 
	yourself. 
	
	You can only modify tagged objects.  Therefore, you need to 
	determine what you are going to modify ahead of time, and tag
	all those objects you are going to alter.  The objects moved/
	modified also depend on the current mode.

	NOTE:  Normal objects are moved relative to your point of view but      
	       things with orientation (starts, robots, and the reactor) are  
	       steered (just like you would fly them). 

--[D1]------ Cubes

	With the desired cube(s) tagged while in cube mode, the following
	modifications apply (mouse clicks are described):

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Nothing.                Slide tagged cubes
						     UP (with respect
						     to current view).
	Down                 Nothing.                Slide tagged cubes
						     DOWN (with respect
						     to current view).
	Left                 Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
			     cubes with respect to   LEFT (with respect
			     the current side.       to current view)
	Right                Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
			     cubes with respect to   RIGHT (with respect
			     the current side.       to current view).
	Up/Right             Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
			     cubes with respect to   AWAY (with respect
			     the current side.       to current view)
	Down/Left            Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
			     cubes with respect to   NEARER (with respect
			     the current side.       to current view)

	When modifying cubes, the tagged cubes are moved/rotated as a
	single unit.  THE CURRENT CUBE IS ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE TAGGED!

	When using the keyboard, however, the 1/3 keys rotates the cubes
	with the current cube.  The 4/6 keys do not include the current
	cube in the rotation (unless, of course, it is also tagged).

--[D2]------ Sides

	With the desired cube side(s) tagged while in side mode, the
	following modifications apply (mouse clicks described):

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
						     UP (with respect
						     to current view).
	Down                 Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
						     DOWN (with respect
						     to current view).
	Left                 Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
						     LEFT (with respect
						     to current view)
	Right                Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
						     RIGHT (with respect
						     to current view).
	Up/Right             Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
						     AWAY (with respect
						     to current view)
	Down/Left            Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
						     NEARER (with respect
						     to current view)

	When modifying sides, ONLY tagged sides are affected.

--[D3]------ Walls

	Wall location/orientation cannot be altered.  To alter, modify
	the side that contains the wall.

--[D4]------ Points

	With the desired point(s) tagged while in side mode, the
	following modifications apply (mouse clicks described):

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Nothing.                Slide tagged points
						     UP (with respect
						     to current view).
	Down                 Nothing.                Slide tagged points
						     DOWN (with respect
						     to current view).
	Left                 Nothing.                Slide tagged points
						     LEFT (with respect
						     to current view)
	Right                Nothing.                Slide tagged points
						     RIGHT (with respect
						     to current view).
	Up/Right             Nothing.                Slide tagged points
						     AWAY (with respect
						     to current view)
	Down/Left            Nothing.                Slide tagged points
						     NEARER (with respect
						     to current view)

	When modifying points, ONLY tagged points are affected.

--[D5]------ Things

	Things are represented by a special symbol in the viewing window
	that indicates it's orientation.  In addition, different things 
	have different symbols.

	Things like the start points, and the reactor are displayed like a
	folded piece of paper that forms sort of a 3-D triangle.  The "fold"
	is the "up" direction, and the thin point is the "front" of the
	thing.  (Try it out, you'll see what I'm talking about).

	Things are moved just like changing your own orientation.  In other
	words, things are modified with respect to their own orientation.
	See "Moving and Looking Around" for the appropriate mouse commands
	and keystrokes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [E]. Macros - Intro

	Macros are the basis for creating new levels.  In simple words, a
	macro is a collection of cubes, sides, walls, and points that are
	grouped together so they can be inserted and/or modified as a 
	single unit.

	When a macro is created, one of the sides was the current side.
	When you insert a macro (i.e. when you add cubes and such to your
	level), the macro is inserted into your level with your current
	side occupying the same space as what was the current side of the
	macro.  (The orientation and alignment of the macro will be 
	discussed in "Macros - Part 2")

	In previous versions of DEVIL, macros were saved in special files
	in the MACRO subdirectory with a file extension of .RMC.  DEVIL
	2.x, however, saves macros in .RDL files, just as regular levels.

	The following steps will illustrate how macros are chosen and 
	used to add cubes to a level:

	  * Select the existing cube to which you want to add more 
	    cubes.
	  * Select a side on the cube that is not attached to anything.
	    This is where the new cubes will be added.
	  * From the Macros pulldown, select "Load Macro".  This will 
	    open a window allowing you to scroll through the list of 
	    available macros.  If no macros are found, you can load an
	    old DEVIL 1.x version macro by selecting "Load Old Macro".
	  * Scroll to find the desired macro with the "Up" and "Down"
	    buttons.  Select the "Long Corridor" macro (LONGCORR.RMC).
	    A separate window is opened in which the macro you just loaded
	    is displayed.  You can view and edit this macro just as you would
	    any other level or macro from within this window.
	  * While in cube mode, and with the desired side set as current,
	    press 'Insert'.  (Or, select "Insert" from the edit menu).  
	    This inserts the new cubes from the macro and
	    aligns the current side with what was the current side within
	    the macro.  At this point, the new cubes are added, but the
	    the new cubes are not connected with the original cube.  The
	    cubes can be connected by either deleting the side that is
	    common between the cubes, or by pressing '[S]+Insert' instead
	    of simply 'Insert'.  This has the added affect of deleting the
	    connecting side for you.  ("Macros - Part 2" explains why 
	    you might not want it to connect them for you right away)
	    Another way to insert a macro is to press the "Insert" pushbutton
	    from inside the "Cube" window with the desired macro selected.
	  * Note that the new cubes are tagged automatically.  This allows
	    you to delete all the inserted cubes easily if you made a 
	    mistake.  When you are satisfied with the new cubes, press
	    '[S]+space' to untag the cubes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [F]. Adding/Deleting Objects

--[F1]------ Cubes

	See "Macros - Intro" and "Macros - Part 2" for insertion 
	instructions.

	There are two ways to delete cubes:
	  - Pressing the DELETE key deletes the current cube.
	  - Tag all cubes you wish to delete and press SHIFT-DELETE.
	DEVIL will ask you for confirmation if the "Ask Del One" and/or
	"Ask Del Tagged" properties are set to "on" in the Internals 
	menu (see section titled "Internal Mode").

	If two cubes are 
	connected, and one of the cubes is deleted, the "open" side of
	the remaining cube is automatically "filled in" with the rock001
	texture.

	In cube mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': Insert the current macro on the current side. The macro
	is inserted in a way that the point which was the current point when
	creating this macro lays on the current point. After inserting the
	macro all objects of the macro are tagged.
	'edit->insert fast': Insert the current macro like in 'edit->insert'
	but also connect the side from the macro with the side of the level.
	The shape of the side of the macro is changed if they don't fit
	together and if DEVIL can find the points belonging together.
	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged cubes. On the sides where they have
	neighbour cubes is a standard-side inserted. If there's a wall in
	the cube, the cube is not deleted.
	'edit->enlarge': Make the current cube bigger. The center of the cube is
	calculated and then the distance of all points to this center is 
	multiplied with the zoom factor (ZoomS. in 'internal'-menu).
	'edit->shrink': Make the current cube smaller. Same as enlarge but 
	with dividing instead of multiplying.
	'macros->insert special': Insert the current macro like in
	'edit->insert', but scale it with a given factor.
	'macros->insert fast,special': Insert the current macro like in
	'edit->fast insert', but scale it with a given factor.
 
--[F2]------ Sides

	A given side can only be added or deleted if it is shared by two
	adjoining cubes.  Deleting a side effectively connects the two
	cubes (thus allowing you to fly from one to the other), while
	inserting a side divides the cubes into two "rooms".

	To insert a side, simply press 'Insert' with the current side set
	to the location where the side is to be added, while in side mode.

	To delete a side, tag the desired side while in side mode with  
	one of the two cubes selected as current.  Then, set the other 
	cube to current, and set the same side you just tagged as current.
	Press '[S]+Delete'.  

	A quick way to join many cubes into a single room by deleting all
	adjoining sides is to tag all desired cubes, and then select "Make Room"
	from the "Edit" pulldown to create a single "room" out of the tagged 
	cubes.

	In side mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert special': If the current side is a connection between two
	cubes, you insert a side in both sides of the cubes, therefore
	you kill the connection. You don't double the points this way,
	so if you move the point belonging to one of the both cubes you still
	also change the other cube (you can avoid this with 'fast insert'
	or with inserting points). You can't do this with sides with walls.
	'edit->insert': Like 'insert special' but the cubes are seperated 
	completely, so you can move one of the cubes independent from the
	other one.
	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged sides&the current side, therefore 
	make connections between the side which is tagged and an opposite side 
	which DEVIL tries to find. If DEVIL doesn't find this side, try to 
	make the connection more obvious (the distance between the points
	smaller, the maximum distance is ConnD. in the internal menue).
	'edit->special delete': Connect the side which is tagged with the 
	current side. DEVIL tries to find the corresponding points. If the 
	connection is ambiguous, try to make the connection more obvious
	(the distance between the points smaller, the maximum distance is 
	UConn.).
	'edit->enlarge': Make the current side bigger. The center of the 
	side is calculated and then the distance of all points to this 
	center is multiplied with the zoom factor (ZoomS.).
	'edit->shrink': Make the current side smaller. Same as enlarge but 
	with dividing instead of multiplying.

--[F3]------ Walls

	Walls are inserted into empty sides that connect two cubes.

	To insert a wall, set the desired side as the current side, and
	press 'Insert' while in wall mode.  (The existing side must have
	been deleted prior to inserting the wall).  You can have a 
	maximum of 128 walls in a single level.  Note also that EACH SIDE
	of a door is considered to be a wall (i.e. a typical door is 2
	walls!)

	To delete a wall, simply tag the walls you wish to be deleted, 
	and, while in wall mode, press 'Delete'.  Deleting one side of
	a wall deletes both sides (i.e. you only have to tag one of the
	two "X's" that make up the wall).

	In wall mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': Insert a standard wall at the current side.
	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged walls.

--[F4]------ Points

	Points cannot be inserted or deleted
	except by inserting or deleting the cubes that define the points.

	In point mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': If you do this with a point which is involved in more
	than one cube, all sides of the current cube depending on this point
	are inserted, so you can move this point independent from the other
	cubes.

--[F5]------ Things

	To insert a thing, set the cube into which you wish the thing to 
	be placed as current, and, while in thing mode, press 'Insert'.

	To delete a thing, tag the desired thing and, while in thing mode,
	press 'Delete'.

	In thing mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': Insert the standard item.
	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged items.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [G]. Macros - Part 2

	A few words should be said about the alignment of cubes when you
	are inserting with a macro.  When you make a macro, DEVIL remembers
	the side and point that are "current". 
	When you insert a macro, DEVIL takes the current point and side and 
	tries to mend these with the point and the side of the macro. DEVIL 
	will therefore turn the cube in the macro to match the two points 
	and sides.  A side effect of this "feature" is that the macro that
	you inserted may appear rotated 90 or 180 degrees from the position
	that you think you wanted.  To remedy this situation, you can do
	one of two things:

	  - Use the normal insert feature (i.e. just pressing 'Insert', 
	    and not '[S]+Insert') to insert the macro.  Then, with all 
	    the inserted cubes tagged, use the Modify arrows to rotate the
	    cubes to their desired orientation.  You can then manually 
	    delete the side between your new and existing cubes.

	  - Simply delete the macro you just inserted (all the cubes of the
	    macro will still be tagged), change the current point to a 
	    different corner of the current side, and re-insert the macro.

	To create a macro, tag all cubes that you wish to become a part of
	your new macro.  Then, set the current point and current side to
	the location where you would like to define as the attachment side.
	To make the macro, press 'M', or select "Make Macro" from the
	"Macros" pulldown.  This creates the macro, but DOES NOT SAVE IT.
	DEVIL 2.x creates a new window and inserts the macro into it.  The
	current side (i.e. the side that is the attach-point) is marked with
	a red cross.  You can name, edit, and save the macro from this
	new window as you see fit.

	When inserting macros, two other features are available:

	  - Insert Special allows you to scale your macro up or down to
	    let you insert big or little versions of your saved macro.
	  - Insert Fast, Special automatically deletes the connecting side
	    along with allowing you to scale the size of your macro.

Part [H]. Object Properties

--[H1]------ Cube Properties

	With a cube selected (or several cubes tagged), there are a variety 
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are displayed
	in the main body of the "Cube" window.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices, or
	type in a particular value, as required.
	Some cube properties are:

	  * Cube Type
		- Normal: A normal cube.
		- Fuel Center: An energy station ("value" has no further
		  meaning).
		- Repair Center: doesn't work
		- Producer: A materialization center produces 3 robots and 
		  can be triggered via a switch 3 times. 
		- Reactor: You must set the cube containing the reactor to
		  this type.  DEVIL will warn you if you try to save a level
		  with a reactor that is not in a reactor cube.
	  * Cube Lighting: The light in the inner cube.  Robots and other 
	    things (items, other players, etc.) are affected by this.
	  * Average Point Lighting: The average of the light in the corners
	    of this cube.  If you change this value, the light of all corners
	    of this cube is changed to the given values.
	  * Producer Data (for Producers...what type of robots it makes)
	    When a cube is a producer, you can select more than one
	    type of robot that can be produced.  Simply click again
	    on the "Produces" button to finish making your choices.
	    DESCENT will choose one of the given robot-types when a robot
	    appears.

--[H2]------ Side Properties

	With a side selected (or several sides tagged), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are displayed
	in the main body of the "Side" window.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices, or
	to change the value.  Textures are chosen by scrolling through the list
	of available textures.  The first column of controls is for the first
	texture, and the second column is for the second texture.
	Some side properties are:

	  * Textures
	  * Origin for T2:  You can turn the second texture around 0, 90, 
	    180, or 270 degrees on the first texture.
	  * Average Point Lighting: The average of the light in the corners
	    of this side.  If you change this value, the light of all corners
	    of this side is changed to the given values.

	Each side has two textures: texture 1 is the 'main' texture, texture 
	2 overlays the first texture. Texture 2 is used for lights, monitors,
	doors, signs,... The complete texture (1+2) is shown in the "Side"
	window. The orientation of the texture is shown by the two 
	blue lines on the current side and on the image of the textures. You
	can change the orientation of the second texture (e.g. to level
	monitors). You can also change the orientation of the whole side 
	using 'fit bitmap'.

	Texture changing is easy: just switch to side-mode and choose 
	texture 1 or 2. Texture 2 is used for signs, monitors or lights. 
	It will lay on top of texture 1 (and you can change it's alignment
	on top of texture 1). Some textures (like lava) are special. 
	These are handled automatically by DESCENT (it's a GREAT game). 
	Change some textures and notice that when you change texture 1, 
	texture 2 (the lights) will remain the same. You may want to change 
	the orientation of the second texture: do that with 'change
	orientation'.

--[H3]------ Wall Properties

	With a wall selected (or several walls), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are displayed
	in the main body of the "Wall" window.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	A wall may have max. two functions (or none): door and switch. 
	Some wall properties are:
	 
	  * Wall Type
		- Blow Door: standard jail door
		- Normal Door
		- Only Texture: like "floating stars" in energy stations
		- Only Switch: nothing visible, but triggers something
		- Shoot Through: but cannot fly through...like windows, 
		  grates, ventilators, etc.
	  * Open/Close Behaviour
		- stay open, laser: once opened, this door stays open 
		- stay open, switch: can only be opened with switches or 
		  at the end of the level
		- open/close w. laser: standard door, closes after a few
		  seconds
		- open/close w. switch: same as with laser, only with switch
	  * Key Requirements
	  * Switch Behaviour (i.e. what does it "activate")
		- no switch (default)
		- alternate/normal exit: when this switch is activated, the
		  computer will attempt to steer the ship to the exit-wall
		  (ends level)  If set to "alternate exit", the next level
		  loaded will be the secret level specified in your .MSN file.
		  If set to "normal exit", the next level loaded will be the
		  next level in your .MSN file.
		- producer/doors: Causes all currently tagged producers/doors
		  to be activated by this switch.
		- Switches: Displays how many producers/doors are triggered
		  by the switch.  Triggered objects are displayed in Red.
	  * Hit Points (for Blow Doors...how hard it is to blow it up.  A
	    typical blow door..such as the jail door in Level 1...has 100
	    hit points)
	  * Animation
	  * Textures
	
	The doortype defines the animation sequence. This is only needed for
	doors. Since it works with side effects (see below) there may be some
	minor problems (well, I've had some but maybe I'm just a bit clumsy).
	Concerning switches: when you want to trigger an event (start 
	producing robots or open door(s)), first insert the switch-wall. Then
	tag all objects you want to trigger (cubes for producers and doors 
	for doors).  Then go again to the switch and change the switch to the
	event. It will show how many objects are affected. If you want to add
	another object, you have to tag all previous objects as well; if you
	want to trigger the event with another switch just do the same
	procedure again ... and again ... and again ... 

	Some properties, such as the Wall Type, affect both sides of the
	wall.  Some properties, such as the Hit Points, must be set for 
	each side of the wall.  (For example, you can create a Blow Door
	that is very easy to destroy from one side, but very difficult
	from the other).

	A wall has two sides and so it has two doors and switches (one for 
	each side). Therefore you can trigger different events depending on
	your flight-direction (remember the first time you entered the Big
	Boss room in Level 7?). When you want to trigger an event by flying
	through a corridor from the left to the right, you should set the
	switch to the left side (see demo level for examples).

	IMPORTANT: Doors that are opened with switches can't be opened with
	laserbolts (normaly). So if you got a door of the type 'open/close
	with switch' it may happen that the player is trapped without the 
	possibility to trigger the switch again. So be sure to make the other
	side of such a door 'open/close w. laser'. You have to press the 
	[SHIFT] key to prevent the side effect (if you don't, DEVIL will 
	change both sides).

	The alternate exit-switch is only of use when you're in a level which
	has an alternate exit (this is e.g. level 10 for secret level 1). When
	you use it in level 1 it will just end the level and go to level 2.
	An exit-corridor isn't needed for this kind of exit because DESCENT
	doesn't steer the ship after passing the alternate exit: the level
	just ends.

--[H4]------ Point Properties

	With a point selected (or several points), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are displayed
	in the main body of the "Point" window.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	Some point properties are:
	 
	  * Position
	    If the grid is switched ON, all points will lay on the grid. 
	    If you try to move a point but can't, the moving factor is below
	    the gridsize.
	  * Lighting: The amount of light present at the given point.

--[H5]------ Thing Properties

	With a thing selected (or several things), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are displayed
	in the main body of the "Thing" window.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	Some thing properties are:
	 
	  * Thing Type
		- Robot
		- Item
		- Start & Co-op Starts
		- Reactor
		- Hostage
	  * Robot "Drop" Behaviour
		- Nothing: robot destroyed -> no item
		- Default: robot destroyed -> "random item" (depends on type of 
		  robot, mostly energy boost and shield)  (Which item and how
		  many is probably defined in the .POF files).
		- Robot: Yes, a destroyed robot can drop more robots..and
		  it can drop many of them!
		- Item: You can customize what a robot drops, and how many
		  items it drops.
	  * Robot Beahviour (Hide, Sit Still, etc.)
	  * Player Number (to which player does the thing pertain)

	An Item consists of an effect and a graphic which may differ. So you
	can make an energy boost and disguise it as mega-missile. The default 
	for an energy boost is, of course, energy boost.

	When you choose 'drop item' you can select the item out of a list. 
	The drop number is the number of this thing the robot drops when
	destroyed.  It may vary between 0 and 127. (DESCENT will become a bit
	slow when 127 items are on screen).  Ever destroyed a class 1 drone
	and recieved 127 mega-missiles? :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [I]. Special Things

--[I1]------ Reactor

	The reactor is your goal.  When you destroy it, you have 50 seconds
	to leave the level through the defined exit(s), or you parish 
	along with everything else.  In Descent, there are two ways (that I
	have figured out) that the reactor can be defined.
	
	  * The most common type of reactor is simply the Reactor thing, 
	    which looks a bit like the old MCP in the movie "Tron".  Such
	    a reactor is inserted as any other thing, but has the 
	    additional requirement of needing to be placed within a cube
	    that is defined as a reactor cube.  (Apart from all the 
	    techie stuff within the game that defines this need, it allows
	    the reactor cube(s) to be seen in red on your Automap).

	  * As learned through Level 7, a "Big Boss 1" robot can take on
	    the characteristics of a reactor.  (That is, when you destroy
	    a Big Boss 1 robot, the destruction countdown starts and all
	    specially marked exit doors will open).  I have tried to find
	    out if the same rule applies to "Big Boss 2", but I have never
	    survived long enough to kill one!  :-)

--[I2]------ Exit

	Defining the exit and exit door(s) is a little bit more complicated
	than other things in DEVIL.  

	  * First, there are exit doors.  These are walls that are defined
	    with the "open at end" attribute.  These doors will not open 
	    until after the reactor has been destroyed.

	  * Second, there are the exit switches.  When you pass through these
	    switches, the computer takes control of your ship and steers it
	    through the last corridor until the real exit is reached (see 
	    next bullet).  These switches can be defined to activate the
	    normal exit (which takes you to the next level in the mission),
	    or the alternate exit (which takes you to one of the "secret"
	    levels).

	  * Third, one side in the level must be defined as the exit side.
	    The exit side is defined as a side that is not adjacent to 
	    any other cube, and is typically placed at the end of a long
	    corridor that connects one of the exit doors with the exit
	    side.  

	Thus, a typical exit consists of 'stay open, switch', 'open at end',
	and the switch 'normal exit'.  The exit-side is the only side that 
	is a wall (not quite right but it should do). Therefore you should
	bend the corridor so that the exit wall can't be seen from the
	beginning of the exit-corridor (because of HOM-effects). I've not
	done so because it's only a stylistic fault and won't do any harm.
	The exit wall has no texture and should therefore be invisible from 
	the point of the door (DESCENT won't crash but it looks better). This 
	can be made by curves in the exit-corridor or by just setting the 
	light level very low.

	IMPORTANT: DESCENT seems to need an exit (we aren't 100% sure). When 
	you load a level without exit it will crash sometimes/sometimes not, 
	depending of the time, your age and the current moon-phase. This 
	freaked us a lot but we thinks we have sorted it out by now.
	The exit-corridor should also have a certain minimal length (try 
	around 10 cubes at least) and it shouldn't have sharp corners (no 
	90 turns).

--[I3]------ Light

	There are two different kinds of light: inner-light (previously called
	cube-light) and point-light.  
	Point light is only available on sides, NOT on walls, and it can be
	edited in the following modes:
  
	  * Point-mode: change the light level of the corner of the 
	    current side   
	  * Side-mode : change the light level of all 4 corners
	  * Cube-mode : change the light level of all corners in the cube

	Now we have a problem. Imagine a cube with 6 adjacent cubes (on each
	side of the cube). Such a cube has only walls and no sides and there-
	fore no light level. But 'lo! Parallax has made something called "inner 
	light". This sets the light level in the cube. It is only available in 
	cube-mode. So it is possible to make a big, dark room (point-light set 
	to 0) with a floating reactor in the middle in bright light. 
	Looks GREAT!  The light value is entered as a percentage of the  
	maximum amount (100%).

	The menu option "Bitmaps->Light Shading" can be used to make a corridor 
	with a very light start cube and a pitch-dark end cube. Just tag cubes 
	so they're forming a corridor, then set the light of the start side 
	which is the side in the startcube opposite of the next tagged cube and 
	the light of the endside. Then use 'Bitmaps->Light shading'. DEVIL will 
	then shade each corner seperately from start to end side. The inner cube 
	light is also shaded.
	The following algorithm is used to set the lights:
	(0) 'current side'=start side, 'light'=start light, 'light add'
	    =difference between start and end light divided through the number
	    of cubes.
	(1) set the light on the 'current side' in each corner to the
	    corresponding 'light'.
	(2) add 'light add' to 'light'. Set the inner cube light to the average
	    of all eight corners. 
	(3) set light at the opposite side of the 'current side' to 'light'.
	(4) search side with next cube. 'current side' is the side of the
	    next cube which corresponds to the found side.
	(5) if this is not the end cube jump to (1).

--[I4]------ Bitmap Manipulation

	* Fit bitmap. (From the "Side" Window - click on the textured box)

	  With this function you can move the textures on the sides. Change 
	  the Move Mode in the "Button" window to "Move Textures", and click
	  on the arrow buttons to adjust the bitmap alignment.
	  Clicking in the "Fit Bitmap" window prompts you if you want to 
	  automatically center and fit the bitmap.  (This function not only
	  centers the bitmap on a square side, but also stretches the bitmap
	  to fit odd-shaped sides.

	* Align bitmaps. ('Bitmaps->Align bitmaps')

	  This feature you can use to align bitmaps so all bitmaps fit 
	  together.  To do this, tag all sides you want to align, and then go 
	  with the current side on one of these sides. Then select
	  'Bitmaps->Align Bitmaps'. DEVIL will take the current side and 
	  align all tagged sides in the neighbour cubes (but only one per 
	  cube) which have a line with the current side common and untag them.
	  Then it goes on with the aligned sides and repeats this as often as
	  there are tagged sides in the neighbour cubes with common lines.

	* Recalculate textures. ('Bitmaps->Recalculate Textures')

	  Just recalculates the shape of the side in texture-space. This you
	  need only if you've locked several sides and now want to recalculate 
	  their shape in texture-space. Normally this is done automatically by 
	  DEVIL.

--[I5]------ New DEVIL 2.0 Shortcuts

	A nice feature of DEVIL 2.0 is the ability to tag, insert, and delete
	objects directly from within the corresponding window.  For example,
	a cube can be tagged by simply pressing the "Tag" pushbutton in the
	"Cube" window.  Similarly, a macro can be inserted, and cubes can
	be deleted, by simply clicking on the "Insert" or "Delete" pushbuttons
	in the "Cube" window.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [J]. Samples

--[J1]------ The Tutorial Levels

	DEVIL comes with three "tutorial" levels (TUT1, TUT2, and TUT3) that
	illustrate the development of a level through several steps, with 
	level TUT3 being the final product.

	TUT1 doesn't contain much that is interesting.  The level consists
	of two corridors that form a "T".  The exit-side is defined at the
	top of the upward sweeping corridor, and the start point is defined
	at the left-most cube of the horizontal corridor (as you are 
	oriented when you first enter DEVIL).  Note that the icon 
	representing your starting position shows that when you start the
	level, you will be facing the left wall, not down the main 
	corridor!

	TUT2 adds two doors (walls).  The door at the end of the
	horizontal corridor will be defined with red-key access, and will
	hide the reactor behind it.  The door blocking the vertical 
	corridor will be defined as an "open at end" door, and will give
	you access to the exit after the reactor has been destroyed.  This
	door will also be defined as the "normal exit" switch.

	TUT3 is the final product, with the exit door fully defined, the
	reactor placed a reactor cube, and a red key placed in the middle 
	of the horizontal corridor.  Note also that the icon representing 
	the reactor has it positioned up-side down!

--[J2]------ The Demo Level

	I'll just describe what you see when you fly through this level.
	First, there is a two-sided (means two different events, depending 
	on your direction) switch for the producers. Then there is an
	energy-station (note: try to achieve a high 'wall-density' in
	energy-stations because when you turn you see that the flecks in 
	the air are just 2D). Next, another two-sided switch for two secret
	doors. The door to the left is 'open/close w. switch' (means: it 
	will close after some time), the other is 'not normally opened' and
	will stay open when opened once via switch. First type is great for
	secret doors with goodies behind, second is for traps with robots
	(remember Level 6?).  Then you'll pass a door and enter a BIG BALL
	(my first real macro :). This room may be a bit slow on some 
	machines (mine for example).  There will be another enemy and the
	reactor.  Notice the mind-wheeling effect corridor <-> ball? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [K]. Hints and Tips

	Here are just some tips what you should try (or not try):

	  - don't make the exit-corridor too short/straight (see "Exit")
	  - insert the reactor in standard cubes so that they won't float 
	    (or steer them to the floor in a bigger room)
	  - default texture for doors is rock001; you don't see it a lot 
	    but change the texture to match adjacent textures 
	  - ceiling (lights) and floor (tiles) should remain the same 
	    through the whole level
	  - monitors and signs should be orientated in the same way
	  - Make a lot of macros.  Building rooms, corridors, etc., can 
	    be easy but time consuming.  Build up a stock of macros, then
	    piece them together to create your level(s).
	  - Make sure nothing is "out of bounds" (outside the cubes)
	  - Keep your brains with you...don't put a red key behind 
	    a red door, for example.
	  - when you make a macro for public use, try to end it with
	    a standard cube (reference point and side)
	  - thank PARALLAX every day
	  - be happy :)
