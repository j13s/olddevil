	Quite a bit of new info has been added, but if you look carefully, 
	you can still find many of Boris' original words.  In addition, be 
	aware that any references to "I", "me", or such, could be a reference

Part [*]. Introduction

	First, a guided tour of what you'll see in DEVIL:

	|                                              +---------+---------+
	|                                              | Move/   | Texture |

	+----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+

	To the left is a big Window: this is where your level is shown. The 
	upper line consists of pull-down menus. To the right there are 
	several displays: in the lower right the texture of the current side 
	is shown. The arrows are for mouse-controlling. Below the arrows is
	an indication of whether you are in Modify or Move mode. 
	Above that are the different editing modes: cubes, sides (a side is
	a cube-side with no adjacent cube), walls (a wall is a cube-side with
	an adjacent cube), points, things and internal. In the upper right
	corner the actual editing-mode is displayed and below that the
	properties and attributes of cubes/sides/walls/... (and so on).

--[*1]------ The Pulldown Menus

	The pulldown menus are activated by pressing '[ALT]+highlighted 
	letter' (for mouse-users now and for ever: just click on the one you
	want).  The following is a list of the different menus and menu 
	items, which will be helpful later as a reference, but won't make
	much sense the first time you read this document.  Their full
	descriptions and explanations will be found throughout this document.
	  
	  * File
		- Load Level: To load a level for editing
		- Save Level: To save the current level
	 	- Play Level: To play the current level as it exists
		- Level Info: Displays statistics about the current level
		- Quit: To exit DEVIL
	  * Move
		- Beam: Repositions point of view to current object
		- Align to...: Reorients point of view along and towards the
		  selected axis.
	  * Edit
		- Insert: Inserts an object or macro.  
		- Special Insert: A special version of Insert.
		- Delete: Deletes currently tagged (selected) objects
		- Delete All:  Delete all tagged objects in every mode.  This
		  is useful if you've inserted a macro the wrong way because 
		  it deletes all things, walls, and cubes.  You are asked to
		  confirm this decision.
		- Enlarge/Shrink: Zooms current view in or out
		- Grid On/Off: Toggles use of the grid for object positioning.
		  If the grid is turned on, all moved points/things are snapped
		  to the grid.  The grid size is changed with 'g' and 'G'.
		- Set Exit: This allows you to set the exit side at the end
		  of the exit corridor.  The exit corridor starts with the
		  exit door and ends with the exit side (it's the corridor 
		  DESCENT steers your glider through at the end).
		- Fit Bitmap: See description in section titled "Bitmap 
		  Manipulation".
		- Align Bitmaps: See description in section titled "Bitmap
		  Manipulation".
		- Light Shading: See description in section titled "Light".
		- Make Room: Removes all common sides between tagged cubes
		  to create a single room out of them.  A common side is
		  found if all four points are within "ConnD" from the 
		  "Internal" menu.
		- Recalculate Textures: See description in section titled
		  "Bitmap Manipulation".
	  * Macros
		- Make Macro: Creates a macro out of currently tagged cubes
		- Save Macro: Save the current macro to a file
		- Choose Macro: Loads a macro from a file for use
		- Insert Scaled: Inserts the cubes and walls of the current
		  macro just as in 'Edit->Insert', but scale it with a given
		  factor.
		- Insert Scaled, Fast: Insert current macro like in 
		  'Edit->Special Insert', but scale it with a given factor.
	  * Select
		- Tag: Tag current object (depending on current mode)
		- Tag All: Tag all objects of current mode (or untag all
		  currently tagged objects)
		- Tag Special: Only used in two modes:
		  * In point mode, tags all corners of the current point
		  * In side mode, you can lock this side.  This means the
		    texture of this side is not calculated anymore if the
		    shape of the side changes.
		- Tag Box: If box is off, draw 3D tag box on the last position.
		  If box wasn't drawn before you do this, the tag box is 
		  inserted at the last loaded starting place as a cube with
		  (30 * gridsize) as the size (direction of the starting place).
		  If tag box is already on, tag all objects of current mode 
		  that lie within the box.  (Cubes and sides are only tagged
		  if they are completely within the box). 
		- New Tag Box: If box is off, init the tag box (45 * gridsize)
		  for your nose with size = (30 * gridsize) aligned on your 
		  current direction.
		- Use Cube Tag: In Side or Point mode, tags all sides/points
		  of the tagged cubes (other tags in this mode are cleared).
		- Use Side Tag: In Point mode, tags all points of the tagged
		  sides (other tags in this mode are cleared).
		- Choose Cube/Thing/Wall: Will prompt for the number of the
		  desired object (depending on the current mode).
		- Goto Wall: Set the current cube and side to the cube and
		  side with the current wall.
		- Next/Previous Cube/Thing/Side/Wall/Point: Changes current
		  object (depending on the current mode) to the next, or
		  previous object (as determined by their numeric sequencing).
		- Change to Sidecube:  If the current cube has a neighbor 
		  cube at the current side, select this neighbor cube as the
		  current cube.
	  * Drawing
		- Each menu item toggles whether objects of that type are
		  currently displayed on the screen.  ('Drawing->X-tagged' is
		  for turning on/off the extra lines in tag mode)
	  * Info
		- Credits: Displays DEVIL credits and product information
		- Help Page: Displays a list of keyboard shortcuts

      [SHIFT] + m                       make macro                       
      [CONTROL] + m                     save macro

      [CONTROL] + [SHIFT] + c/s/w/p/t   enter number of current cube ...
      [SPACE]                           tag untagged object or 
                                        untag tagged object
      [SHIFT] + [SPACE]                 tag all objects if none are tagged or 
                                        untag all objects if one is tagged
      [CONTROL] + key                   command only for current object,

      [SHIFT] + key                     no side-effects 
      [SHIFT] + [DELETE]                delete all tagged objects (be careful                           
                                        with this one!)
      [END]                             insert exit wall in current side
      cursor up/down                    move in substructure-menu
      [RETURN]                          edit substructure
      f                                 fit bitmap of current side (f also
                                        exits the bitmap-fitting)

--[*3]------ Object Properties

	In the Object Properties menu on the right side, you see a "*" before
	the current entry.  You can move this with 'cursor up' and 'cursor
	down' and change the entry with 'return', or simply click with the 
	mouse.

	Sometimes when you select an item, the current menu is replaced by a
	list of possible choices.  You can select an item from this list with
	'space' or 'return' or the left mouse button.  The old value is marked
	with a "#".  You can scroll up and down with 'page up' and 'page down'
	or the right mouse button in the upper or lower half of the list, go
	to the top of the list with 'home' and to the end with 'end'.  If you
	go to the line with the topic, you can enter a number which is not
	available on the list.

	If it is possible to select more than one item in a list, 'space' marks
	the item and 'return' ends the selection and changes the entry.  With
	'Esc' you can end the selection without changing the entry.

	If not explicitly stated, the change is done with all tagged objects.
	You can avoid this by pressing 'ctrl' when selecting the item.

	Some menu entries have side effects when changed.  This means that
	DEVIL changes more than just the entry you've selected (see explanation
	of Walls).  You can suppress side effects by pressing 'shift' when
	selecting the entry you would like to change  You can also combine
	'shift'+'ctrl' to change only the current object without tagged 
	objects and without side effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [A]. Moving and Looking Around

	The first thing about DEVIL you'll need to learn is how to move
	around and look at the object that you care about.  It's a little 
	tricky at first, but it gets easier the more you use it.

	On the lower right-hand side of the screen is a grid containing
        (usually) 7 "buttons" arranged like this:

	+----------+----------+----------+
	|     /    |    A     |     7    |
	|    L     |    I     |    /     |
        +----------+----------+----------+
	|          |    I     |          |
	|    <-    |    V     |    ->    |
	+----------+----------+----------+
	|                                |
	|             Move               |
        +--------------------------------+

	The bottom-most button starts out with the word "Move", and can
        be toggled between "Move" and "Modify".  "Move" means you are going 
        to move yourself, and "Modify" means you are going to modify an 
	object in the window.

	Your current position and orientation are displayed as two sets
	of three numbers on the lower right-hand portion of the screen
	and look something like this:

		0.5,0.0,-160.5
		0.000,0.000,1.000

	The first set of three numbers is your current position as given
	by your X, Y, and Z coordinates.  So, if your position is {0,0,100},
	you are currently "located" at point 100 on the positive Z-axis.

	The second set of three numbers is your current orientation.  Each
	value in your orientation can be considered as the degree to 
	which you are looking in that direction, with 1.000 indicating 
	you are looking straight down the positive axis (with higher
	numbers going away from you, and -1.000 indicating you are looking
	straight down the negative axis (with smaller numbers going away
	from you).  

	A new feature of v1.02 is a small wire-frame that lies to the right
	of the location/orientation numbers.  This can help you determine
	your current viewing orientation.  The Red axis is the positive X-axis.  
	The White axis is the positive Y-axis.  The Yellow axis is the 
	positive Z-axis.  (Thanks Achim! - This is proof that he listens to
	suggestions!)

	In your default orientation (where you are when you load the
	NEW.rdl level file), you are at orientation {0.000,0.000,1.000}
	(looking up the Z-axis).  When you begin in this default 
	orientation, the X-axis runs from left to right, the Y-axis
	runs bottom to top, and the Z-axis runs into the display.  

	After starting in your default orientation, there is no visible
	indication (other than the level structure you see in the main
	viewing area), what your "rotational" orientation is.

--[A1]------ Using the Mouse

	With the bottom-most buttons set to "Move", your movement and 
	view is altered in the following ways, depending on which mouse
	button you use when you click on each of the six arrow buttons:

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Tilt nose DOWN          Slide Up
	                     (view rotates up)	     (view slides down)
	Down                 Tilt nose UP            Slide Down
	                     (view rotates down)     (view slides up)
	Left                 Turn nose RIGHT         Slide Left
	                     (view rotates left)     (view slides right)
	Right                Turn nose LEFT          Slide Right
	                     (view rotates right)    (view slides left)
	Up/Right             Spin CLOCKWISE (view    Slide Forward
	                     spins counter-wise)     (view "grows")
	Down/Left            Spin COUNTER-C-WISE     Slide Backward
	                     (view spins clockwise)  (view "backs away")
	
--[A2]------ Using the Keyboard

	On the keyboard, the movement commands are:  (you have to switch 
	the NUMLOCK ON):

        A/Y (perhaps Z ?)       forwards/backwards (sorry, german keyboard)
        1/3                     banking
        2/4/6/8                 turn around
        [SHIFT]+2/4/6/8         gliding

      	IMPORTANT: when I refer to NUMLOCK ON or OFF, I assume that you 
	change the Move/Modify-mode ONLY with your NUM-key. 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [B]. The Modes

 	There are 6 different "modes" in DEVIL.  Each mode is used to add
	objects of different types, and to change the properties of 
	different types of objects.  Each of the 6 modes is described
	separately.

      	You change modes by pressing [CONTROL] and the first letter of the 
	mode that wish to be in.  Side mode would be '[C]+S', '[C]+P' for
	point-mode, and so on.  You will notice that every time you change 
	the mode the display in the upper right corner will change to 
	display your current editing possibilities. 

	Some actions act different in different modes, e.g. INSERT in cube-
	mode inserts a macro, in thing-mode a thing and in point-mode ....
	NO! Not a point. You can't insert points :). 

	Each mode has a different set of attributes and properties.  You 
	change the properties using the cursor-keys and [RETURN]. (Ok, ok: 
	for mouse-users: just move the little arrow to the property you want
	to change and press a mouse-button.) Then you got either another 
	menu (e.g. of different robots) or you have to enter a number.  

--[B1]------ Cube Mode

	Cube Mode allows you to change the properties of a cube as a whole,
	and to add or delete entire cubes.  Some properties include the 
	room type, average cube lighting, and average point lighting.

	For experienced WAD-builders: cubes are sth. like sectors (not quite
	right: while it was possible to divide a sector in parts that are not 
	connected, this is not allowed with cubes). A cube has always eight 
	corners but you may arange these points (almost) as you want. You have
	to keep in mind:
	  * Cubes need to be convex. Well, what does that mean?  That means,
	    you can draw a line from every point inside the cube to every
	    other point and this line DOES NOT LEAVE THE CUBE. This is
	    important for DESCENT. Let me show you some examples:
               ________                 __________        ___    ___
              |        |                \        /        \  \  /  /
              |        |                 \      /          \  \/  /
          YES:|        |    CLOSE THING:  \    /      NO:   \    /
              |        |                   \  /              \  /
              |________|                    \/                \/

	    Luckily, DEVIL handles this thing automatically, so you won't have
	    to be bothered.
	  * Take a normal cube and push one corner inwards. This will not 
	    only make the cube 'lesser convex' but it will also bent the 
	    adjacent sides of the cube (try it for yourself). DESCENT has
	    problems with highly bent walls (e.g. the laserbolts won't 
	    collide with the wall) but DEVIL won't allow such walls and 
	    will refuse to move a point	further.
	You don't have to think about wether or not this cube is allowed be-
	cause DEVIL does it for you (thanks, Achim!). I just mentioned these
	problems so that you can understand why DEVIL refuses to execute a 
	command.

	A "standard cube" is 20x20x20 in size.  The level "new.rdl" is an
	example of such a cube.

--[B2]------ Side Mode

	Side Mode allows you to change the properties of one particular 
	side of a cube.  Some properties include the texture(s) of the
	side, and the average point lighting.

	A side has allways a texture, a wall may have a texture. Textures in
	DESCENT are a bit more 'powerful' than in DOOM (they are not only 
	textures). E.g. the lava-texture behaves like lava, this is only 
	because of the texture.

--[B3]------ Wall Mode

	Wall Mode allows you to change the properties of one particular 
	wall, and to add or delete walls.  Walls are sides that are shared
	by two cubes and can otherwise be called doors (which open and 
	close) or switches (which cause other things to happen).  Some 
	properties of walls include the wall type, the open/close 
	behavior, the key required, the objects it "activates" (if it's
	a switch), the hit points (how much does it have to be shot to
	destroy it), and the texture(s).

--[B4]------ Point Mode

	Point Mode allows you to change the properties of a particular
	point.  Some properties of a point include the X, Y, and Z co-
	ordinates, and the lighting.

--[B5]------ Thing Mode

	Things are everything else in the game that makes it fun.  Thing
	Mode allows you to change the properties of a thing.  There are
	several types of things:  items (like power-ups and weapons), 
	robots (the bad guys), hostages (the innocent victims), the start
	location(s), and the reactor.  Different things have different
	properties, so I won't mention them yet.

--[B6]------ Internal Mode

	Internal Mode allows you to change different behaviours of the
	DEVIL editor itself, such as how far to move something each time
	you click, how much to rotate an object, how much you can see, 
	and so on.  

	The properties that can be modified are:

	Property        Description
	-------------   -----------------------------------------------
	Zoom		Your magnification factor (this is NOT the same
	                as sliding foward/backward).
	ZoomS           The factor the zoom factor (Zoom) is multiplied/
			divided by when you press '-' (shrink) or
			'+' (enlarge).
	Visib.          How far into the distance you can see
	VisiS.          The factor the visibility (Visib.) is
			multiplied/divided by when you press
	                '[S]+a' (see more) or '[S]+z' (see less).
	Movef.          How far you move when you move
	PMovef.         How far a point is moved when you move them
	MoveS           The factor Movef and PMovef is multiplied/divided by
			when you press '*' (multiply) or '/' (divide).
	Angel           (We'll forgive Achim's spelling mistake)  Rotation
			angle when you turn  yourself.
	PAngel          Rotation angle for objects
	AngelS          The multiply/divide factor for Angel and PAngel when
			you press '7' (divide) or '9' (multiply).
	Grid            Size of the grid.  When "on", the grid forces points
	                to exist on an angular grid.
	GridS           Factor for changing the size of the grid when 'g'
			(multiply) or 'G' (divide) are pressed.
	ConnD.          The maximum distance for two points when you try
			to connect them using 'Del' in side mode, or when you
			use "make room" feature.
	UConn.          The maximum distance for two points when you try
			to connect them with while inserting a macro and
			when using 'Shift+Del' in side mode.
	clickangle      The angle of the clicking beam:  as you increase it,
			it will be easier to hit something; if you decrease
			it, you have a better chance to hit one of two things
			near together.  (Note: be careful...this is the cosine
			of the angle from your mouse point).
	thingsize       Size of the symbol for the things in the edit window.
	door bend       How much the middle of the "X" representing a wall
			(door) is bent away from the side it occupies.
	xpos            Current position on X-axis
	ypos            Current position on Y-axis
	zpos            Current position on Z-axis
	map angle       With "Drawing->Lines" turned off, this value controls
			the number of lines that are actually drawn.  All lines
			between two sides are drawn when the angle between the
			two sides is larger than this angle.  This is the 
			cosine of the angle.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [C]. Selecting and Tagging

	DEVIL uses colors to illustrate the current cube, side, point, wall,
	and/or thing that is selected, as well as the cubes, sides, etc., 
	that are tagged.  In DEVIL, and object can be the "current"
	object (of which there can only be one), and can be one of several
	"tagged" (selected) objects.

	The current cube, wall, or thing is displayed in green.  The current
	point is shown by a 3-dimensional red "X".  The current side is 
	shown as a 4-sided polygon (typically a square) with one side 
	yellow, one side purple, and two red sides.  The yellow line 
	indicates the "top" of the side (as far as textures are concerned)
	and the purple side indicates the "left" of the side (as seen 
	while standing within the current cube).

	Choosing the current cube can be done in several ways:
	  - Using the mouse, click the right mouse button (2) on a 
	    corner of the desired cube.
	  - Press 'c' to set the next cube (in numerical order) as the
	    current cube.  (or choose "Next Cube" from the pulldown)
	  - Press 'C' ('[S]+c') to set the previous cube (in numerical
	    order) as the current cube. (or choose "Previous Cube" from
            the pulldown)
	  - Press '[C]+c' and type in the number of the cube you wish
	    to make current.  (or choose "Choose Cube" from the pulldown)

	Once the current cube has been chosen, the desired cube side
	can be made the current side in several ways:
	  - Press 's' to set the next cube side (in numerical order) as
	    the current cube side.
	  - Press 'S' ('[S]+s') to set the previous cube side (in 
	    numerical order) as the current cube side.

	With the current side chosen, the desired point can be made the 
	current in several ways:
	  - Press 'p' to set the next point (in numerical order) as
	    the current point on the current side.
	  - Press 'P' ('[S]+p') to set the previous point (in 
	    numerical order) as the current point on the current side.

	A handy feature exists to make current a cube that is next to your
	current cube.  With one side selected as current, pressing the '0'
	(zero) key will make the cube that is adjacent to the current cube
	via the current side the new current cube.

	Choosing the current wall can be done in several ways:
	  - Using the mouse, click the right mouse button (2) on the
	    'X' that denotes the side of the wall you are interested
	    in while holding down the [C] (control) key.
	  - Press 'w' to set the next wall (in numerical order) as
	    the current wall. 
	  - Press 'W' ('[S]+w') to set the previous wall (in 
	    numerical order) as the current wall.

	Choosing the current thing can be done in several ways:
	  - Using the mouse, click the lef mouse button (1) on the
	    thing you are interested in while holding down the [C]
	    (control) key.
	  - Press 't' to set the next thing (in numerical order) as
	    the current thing.
	  - Press 'T' ('[S]+t') to set the previous thing (in 
	    numerical order) as the current thing.

	An object that is tagged is shown in blue.  (Note that it may be
	difficult to determine if a current object is also tagged because
	only one color can be used at a time!)  For many of the operations
	in DEVIL, only those objects that are tagged will be affected by
	the chosen operation.

	The type of object tagged is the same as the current mode.  Thus,
	only cubes can be tagged while in cube mode, and so on. 

	There are many ways to tag objects, and some (as many as I've
	figured out how to use) are listed here:

	  - The current object is tagged/untagged by pressing the spacebar.
	  - '[S]+space' either untags all currently tagged objects, or 
	    tags all items of the specified type if none are tagged.
	  - A 3-D "tag box" can be activated with 'B'.  A red 3D box will
	    appear in the level and there is another move mode for changing
	    the position and size of this box.  Pressing 'b' will then tag
	    all objects within the red box.  This method is not very useful
	    (even Achim agrees), mainly because it's difficult to tell what
	    is inside the box.
	  - A similar 2-D tag box is available by clicking with the left
	    mouse button while holding down the shift key.  A 2D box can 
	    then be drawn.  All objects within this 2D box (extending 
	    forward and backward to infinity) will be tagged.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [D]. Object Location and Orientation

      	If you want to move something else instead yourself you have to 
	switch the NUMLOCK OFF (or click on the button below the arrows).
	Or, click on the "Move/Modify" button until the setting is 
	"Modify".  This allows you to move/rotate objects instead of 
	yourself. 
	
	You can only modify tagged objects.  Therefore, you need to 
	determine what you are going to modify ahead of time, and tag
	all those objects you are going to alter.  The objects moved/
	modified also depend on the current mode.

	NOTE:  Normal objects are moved relative to your point of view but 	
	       things with orientation (starts, robots, and the reactor) are  
	       steered (just like you would fly them). 

--[D1]------ Cubes

	With the desired cube(s) tagged while in cube mode, the following
	modifications apply (mouse clicks are described):

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Nothing.                Slide tagged cubes
                                                     UP (with respect
                                                     to current view).
	Down	             Nothing.                Slide tagged cubes
	                                             DOWN (with respect
	                                             to current view).
	Left                 Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
	                     cubes with respect to   LEFT (with respect
	                     the current side.       to current view)
	Right                Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
	                     cubes with respect to   RIGHT (with respect
	                     the current side.       to current view).
	Up/Right             Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
	                     cubes with respect to   AWAY (with respect
	                     the current side.       to current view)
	Down/Left            Rotates (banks) tagged  Slide tagged cubes
	                     cubes with respect to   NEARER (with respect
	                     the current side.       to current view)

	When modifying cubes, the tagged cubes are moved/rotated as a
	single unit.  THE CURRENT CUBE IS ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE TAGGED!

	When using the keyboard, however, the 1/3 keys rotates the cubes
	with the current cube.  The 4/6 keys do not include the current
	cube in the rotation (unless, of course, it is also tagged).

--[D2]------ Sides

	With the desired cube side(s) tagged while in side mode, the
	following modifications apply (mouse clicks described):

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
                                                     UP (with respect
                                                     to current view).
	Down	             Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
	                                             DOWN (with respect
	                                             to current view).
	Left                 Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
	                                             LEFT (with respect
	                                             to current view)
	Right                Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
	                                             RIGHT (with respect
	                                             to current view).
	Up/Right             Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
	                                             AWAY (with respect
	                                             to current view)
	Down/Left            Nothing.                Slide tagged sides
	                                             NEARER (with respect
	                                             to current view)

	When modifying sides, ONLY tagged sides are affected.

--[D3]------ Walls

	Wall location/orientation cannot be altered.

--[D4]------ Points

	With the desired point(s) tagged while in side mode, the
	following modifications apply (mouse clicks described):

	Arrow Icon           Left Button (1)         Right Button (2)
	----------------     --------------------    ------------------      
	Up                   Nothing.                Slide tagged points
                                                     UP (with respect
                                                     to current view).
	Down	             Nothing.                Slide tagged points
	                                             DOWN (with respect
	                                             to current view).
	Left                 Nothing.                Slide tagged points
	                                             LEFT (with respect
	                                             to current view)
	Right                Nothing.                Slide tagged points
	                                             RIGHT (with respect
	                                             to current view).
	Up/Right             Nothing.                Slide tagged points
	                                             AWAY (with respect
	                                             to current view)
	Down/Left            Nothing.                Slide tagged points
	                                             NEARER (with respect
	                                             to current view)

	When modifying points, ONLY tagged points are affected.

--[D5]------ Things

	Things are represented by a special symbol in the viewing window
	that indicates it's orientation.  In addition, different things 
	have different symbols.

	Things like the start points, and the reactor are displayed like a
	folded piece of paper that forms sort of a 3-D triangle.  The "fold"
	is the "up" direction, and the thin point is the "front" of the
	thing.  (Try it out, you'll see what I'm talking about).

	Things are moved just like changing your own orientation.  In other
	words, things are modified with respect to their own orientation.
	See "Moving and Looking Around" for the appropriate mouse commands
	and keystrokes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [E]. Macros - Intro

      	Macros are the basis for creating new levels.  In simple words, a
	macro is a collection of cubes, sides, walls, and points that are
	grouped together so they can be inserted and/or modified as a 
	single unit.

	Macros are grouped into one of 5 categories to help you find the
	right one you're looking for.  The categories, with the default
	macros (the ones that came with DEVIL) are as follows:

	  - Others
	  - Single Cubes
	    CUBE1.RMC (StandardCube)
	  - Corridors
	    LONGCORR.RMC (LongCorridor)
	  - Intersections
	  - Rooms
	    BIGBALL.RMC (BigBall)
	    DOME.RMC (Dome from Level 7)

	When a macro is created, one of the sides was the current side.
	When you insert a macro (i.e. when you add cubes and such to your
	level), the macro is inserted into your level with your current
	side occupying the same space as what was the current side of the
	macro.  (The orientation and alignment of the macro will be 
	discussed in "Macros - Part 2")

	The following steps will illustrate how macros are chosen and 
	used to add cubes to a level:

	  * Select the existing cube to which you want to add more 
	    cubes.
	  * Select a side on the cube that is not attached to anything.
            This is where the new cubes will be added.
	  * From the Macros pulldown, select "Choose Macro", or simply
	    type "m".  This will display the list of macro groups on the
	    right-hand side of the screen.
	  * Using the arrow keys or the mouse, select the "Corridors"
	    group with the enter key or the mouse button.  Then, select
	    the "Long Corridor" macro (LONGCORR.RMC).
	  * While in cube mode, and with the desired side set as current,
	    press 'Insert'.  This inserts the new cubes from the macro and
	    aligns the current side with what was the current side within
	    the macro.  At this point, the new cubes are added, but the
	    the new cubes are not connected with the original cube.  The
	    cubes can be connected by either deleting the side that is
	    common between the cubes, or by pressing '[S]+Insert' instead
	    of simply 'Insert'.  This has the added affect of deleting the
	    connecting side for you.  ("Macros - Part 2" explains why 
	    you might not want it to connect them for you right away)
	  * Note that the new cubes are tagged automatically.  This allows
	    you to delete all the inserted cubes easily if you made a 
	    mistake.  When you are satisfied with the new cubes, press
	    '[S]+space' to untag the cubes.

Part [F]. Adding/Deleting Objects

--[F1]------ Cubes

	See "Macros - Intro" and "Macros - Part 2" for insertion 
	instructions.

	To delete cube(s), simply go into cube mode, tag all cubes you
	wish to delete, and press the Delete key.  If two cubes are 
	connected, and one of the cubes is deleted, the "open" side of
	the remaining cube is automatically "filled in" with the rock001
	texture.

	In cube mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': Insert the current macro on the current side. The macro
	is inserted in a way that the point which was the current point when
	creating this macro lays on the current point. After inserting the
	macro all objects of the macro are tagged.
   	'edit->insert special': Insert the current macro like in 'edit->insert'
	but also connect the side from the macro with the side of the level.
	The shape of the side of the macro is changed if they don't fit
	together and if DEVIL can find the points belonging together.
   	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged cubes. On the sides where they have
    	neighbour cubes is a standard-side inserted. If there's a wall in
   	the cube, the cube is not deleted.
   	'edit->enlarge': Make the current cube bigger. The center of the cube is
    	calculated and then the distance of all points to this center is 
    	multiplied with the zoom factor (ZoomS. in 'internal'-menu).
   	'edit->shrink': Make the current cube smaller. Same as enlarge but 
    	with dividing instead of multiplying.
   	'macros->insert scaled': Insert the current macro like in
	'edit->insert',	but scale it with a given factor.
   	'macros->insert fast,scaled': Insert the current macro like in
    	'edit->fast insert', but scale it with a given factor.
 
--[F2]------ Sides

	A given side can only be added or deleted if it is shared by two
	adjoining cubes.  Deleting a side effectively connects the two
	cubes (thus allowing you to fly from one to the other), while
	inserting a side divides the cubes into two "rooms".

	To insert a side, simply press 'Insert' with the current side set
	to the location where the side is to be added, while in side mode.

	To delete a side, tag the desired side while in side mode with  
	one of the two cubes selected as current.  Then, set the other 
	cube to current, and set the same side you just tagged as current.
	Press '[S]+Delete'.  

	A quick way to join many cubes into a single room by deleting all
	adjoining sides is to tag all desired cubes, and then press F3 
	(or select "Make Room" from the "Edit" pulldown) to create a 
	single "room" out of the tagged cubes.

	In side mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert special': If the current side is a connection between two
	cubes, you insert a side in both sides of the cubes, therefore
	you kill the connection. You don't double the points this way,
	so if you move the point belonging to one of the both cubes you still
	also change the other cube (you can avoid this with 'fast insert'
	or with inserting points). You can't do this with sides with walls.
	'edit->insert': Like 'insert special' but the cubes are seperated 
	completely, so you can move one of the cubes independent from the
	other one.
	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged sides&the current side, therefore 
	make connections between the side which is tagged and an opposite side 
	which DEVIL tries to find. If DEVIL doesn't find this side, try to 
	make the connection more obvious (the distance between the points
	smaller, the maximum distance is ConnD. in the internal menue).
	'edit->special delete': Connect the side which is tagged with the 
	current	side. DEVIL tries to find the corresponding points. If the 
	connection is ambiguous, try to make the connection more obvious
	(the distance between the points smaller, the maximum distance is 
	UConn.).
	'edit->enlarge': Make the current side bigger. The center of the 
	side is	calculated and then the distance of all points to this 
	center is multiplied with the zoom factor (ZoomS.).
	'edit->shrink': Make the current side smaller. Same as enlarge but 
	with dividing instead of multiplying.

--[F3]------ Walls

	Walls are inserted into empty sides that connect two cubes.

	To insert a wall, set the desired side as the current side, and
	press 'Insert' while in wall mode.  (The existing side must have
	been deleted prior to inserting the wall).

	To delete a wall, simply tag the walls you wish to be deleted, 
	and, while in wall mode, press 'Delete'.  Deleting one side of
	a wall deletes both sides (i.e. you only have to tag one of the
	two "X's" that make up the wall).

	In wall mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': Insert a standard wall at the current side.
	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged walls.

--[F4]------ Points

	As far as I can determine, points cannot be inserted or deleted
	except by inserting or deleting the cubes that define the points.

	In point mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': If you do this with a point which is involved in more
	than one cube, all sides of the current cube depending on this point
	are inserted, so you can move this point independent from the other
	cubes.

--[F5]------ Things

	To insert a thing, set the cube into which you wish the thing to 
	be placed as current, and, while in thing mode, press 'Insert'.

	To delete a thing, tag the desired thing and, while in thing mode,
	press 'Delete'.

	In thing mode, the following pulldown menus have special meaning:

	'edit->insert': Insert the standard item.
	'edit->delete': Delete all tagged items.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [G]. Macros - Part 2

	A few words should be said about the alignment of cubes when you
	are inserting with a macro.  When you make a macro, DEVIL remembers
	the side and point that are "current". 
	When you insert a macro, DEVIL takes the current point and side and 
	tries to mend these with the point and the side of the macro. DEVIL 
	will therefore turn the cube in the macro to match the two points 
	and sides.  A side effect of this "feature" is that the macro that
	you inserted may appear rotated 90 or 180 degrees from the position
	that you think you wanted.  To remedy this situation, you can do
	one of two things:

	  - Use	the normal insert feature (i.e. just pressing 'Insert', 
	    and not '[S]+Insert') to insert the macro.  Then, with all 
	    the inserted cubes tagged, use the Modify arrows to rotate the
	    cubes to their desired orientation.  You can then manually 
	    delete the side between your new and existing cubes.

	  - Simply delete the macro you just inserted (all the cubes of the
	    macro will still be tagged), change the current point to a 
	    different corner of the current side, and re-insert the macro.

	To create a macro, tag all cubes that you wish to become a part of
	your new macro.  Then, set the current point and current side to
	the location where you would like to define as the attachment side.
	To make the macro, press 'M', or select "Make Macro" from the
	"Macros" pulldown.  This creates the macro, but DOES NOT SAVE IT.

	Once you've made your macro, you have two options:  Use your macro 
	as you wish by inserting in cube mode, or save your macro for
	future use.  To save your macro, press '[C]+m', or select "Save
	Macro" from the "Macros" pulldown.  You will be prompted for the
	filename into which the macro will be saved, along with a short
	text description to help you remember what the macro is.  Then,
	select the macro group under which the macro will be catagorized.

	When inserting macros, two other features are available:

	  - Insert Scaled allows you to scale your macro up or down to
	    let you insert big or little versions of your saved macro.
	  - Insert Fast, Scaled automatically deletes the connecting side
	    along with allowing you to scale the size of your macro.

Part [H]. Object Properties

--[H1]------ Cube Properties

	With a cube selected (or several cubes tagged), there are a variety 
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are listed in
	the upper right-hand portion of the screen.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	Some cube properties are:

	  * Cube Type
		- Normal: A normal cube.
		- Fuel Center: An energy station ("value" has no further
		  meaning).
		- Repair Center: doesn't work
		- Producer: A materialization center produces 3 robots and 
		  can be triggered via a switch 3 times. 
      		  When the cube is changed to producer you'll have to enter
		  the kind of robot(s) this producer shall produce. You can
		  mark more then one type (with [SPACE]) and press [RETURN]
		  when you're done. DESCENT will choose one of the given 		  	  robot-types when a robot appears.
		- Reactor: You must set the cube containing the reactor to
		  this type.  DEVIL will warn you if you try to save a level
		  with a reactor that is not in a reactor cube.
	  * Cube Lighting: The light in the inner cube.  Robots and other 
	    things (items, other players, etc.) are affected by this.
	  * Average Point Lighting: The average of the light in the corners
	    of this cube.  If you change this value, the light of all corners
	    of this cube is changed to the given values.
	  * Value
	  * Producer Data (for Producers...what type of robots it makes)

--[H2]------ Side Properties

	With a side selected (or several sides tagged), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are listed in
	the upper right-hand portion of the screen.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	Some side properties are:

	  * Textures
	  * Origin for T2:  You can turn the second texture around 0, 90, 
	    180, or 270 degrees on the first texture.
	  * Average Point Lighting: The average of the light in the corners
	    of this side.  If you change this value, the light of all corners
	    of this side is changed to the given values.

	Each side has two textures: texture 1 is the 'main' texture, texture 
	2 overlays the first texture. Texture 2 is used for lights, monitors,
	doors, signs,... The complete texture (1+2) is shown in the lower 
	right corner. The orientation of the texture is shown by the two 
	blue lines on the current side and on the image of the textures. You
	can change the orientation of the second texture (e.g. to level
	monitors). You can also change the orientation of the whole side 
	using 'fit bitmap' (in the pulldown-menu or hotkey 'f').

      	Texture changing is easy: just switch to side-mode and choose 
	texture 1 or 2. Texture 2 is used for signs, monitors or lights. 
	It will lay on top of texture 1 (and you can change it's alignment
	on top of texture 1). Some textures (like lava) are special. 
	These are handled automatically by DESCENT (it's a GREAT game). 
	Change some textures and notice that when you change texture 1, 
	texture 2 (the lights) will remain the same. You may want to change 
	the orientation of the second texture: do that with 'change
	orientation'.

--[H3]------ Wall Properties

      	With a wall selected (or several walls), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are listed in
	the upper right-hand portion of the screen.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	A wall may have max. two functions (or none): door and switch. 
	Some wall properties are:
	 
	  * Wall Type
		- Blow Door: standard jail door
		- Normal Door
		- Only Texture: like "floating stars" in energy stations
		- Only Switch: nothing visible, but triggers something
		- Shoot Through: but cannot fly through...like windows, 
		  grates, ventilators, etc.
	  * Open/Close Behaviour
		- stay open, laser: once opened, this door stays open 
		- stay open, switch: can only be opened with switches or 
		  at the end of the level
		- open/close w. laser: standard door, closes after a few
		  seconds
		- open/close w. switch: same as with laser, only with switch
	  * Key Requirements
	  * Switch Behaviour (i.e. what does it "activate")
		- no switch (default)
		- alternate/normal exit: when this switch is activated, the
		  computer will attempt to steer the ship to the exit-wall
		  (ends level)  If set to "alternate exit", the next level
	          loaded will be the secret level specified in your .MSN file.
		  If set to "normal exit", the next level loaded will be the
	 	  next level in your .MSN file.
		- producer/doors: Causes all currently tagged producers/doors
	  	  to be activated by this switch.
		- Switches: Displays how many producers/doors are triggered
		  by the switch.  Triggered objects are displayed in Red.
	  * Hit Points (for Blow Doors...how hard it is to blow it up.  A
	    typical blow door..such as the jail door in Level 1...has 100
	    hit points)
	  * Animation
	  * Textures
	
	The doortype defines the animation sequence. This is only needed for
	doors. Since it works with side effects (see below) there may be some
	minor problems (well, I've had some but maybe I'm just a bit clumsy).
	Concerning switches: when you want to trigger an event (start 
	producing robots or open door(s)), first insert the switch-wall. Then
	tag all objects you want to trigger (cubes for producers and doors 
	for doors).  Then go again to the switch and change the switch to the
	event. It will show how many objects are affected. If you want to add
	another object,	you have to tag all previous objects as well; if you
	want to trigger the event with another switch just do the same
	procedure again ... and	again ... and again ... 

	Some properties, such as the Wall Type, affect both sides of the
	wall.  Some properties, such as the Hit Points, must be set for 
	each side of the wall.  (For example, you can create a Blow Door
	that is very easy to destroy from one side, but very difficult
	from the other).

	A wall has two sides and so it has two doors and switches (one for 
	each side). Therefore you can trigger different events depending on
	your flight-direction (remember the first time you entered the Big
	Boss room in Level 7?). When you want to trigger an event by flying
	through a corridor from the left to the right, you should set the
	switch to the left side (see demo level for examples).

	IMPORTANT: Doors that are opened with switches can't be opened with
	laserbolts (normaly). So if you got a door of the type 'open/close
	with switch' it may happen that the player is trapped without the 
	possibility to trigger the switch again. So be sure to make the other
	side of	such a door 'open/close w. laser'. You have to press the 
	[SHIFT] key to prevent the side effect (if you don't, DEVIL will 
	change both sides).

	The alternate exit-switch is only of use when you're in a level which
	has an alternate exit (this is e.g. level 10 for secret level 1). When
	you use it in level 1 it will just end the level and go to level 2.
	An exit-corridor isn't needed for this kind of exit because DESCENT
	doesn't steer the ship after passing the alternate exit: the level
	just ends.

--[H4]------ Point Properties

      	With a point selected (or several points), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are listed in
	the upper right-hand portion of the screen.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	Some point properties are:
	 
	  * Position
      	    If the grid is switched ON, all points will lay on the grid. 
	    If you try to move a point but can't, the moving factor is below
	    the gridsize.
	  * The coordinates of the point on the texture that is present
	    on the current side.  (These are the txt-x and txt-y properties,
	    which are typically altered when the Fit Bitmap feature is 
	    used to place the shape of the side on the bitmap).
	  * Lighting: The amount of light present at the given point.

--[H5]------ Thing Properties

      	With a thing selected (or several things), there are a variety
	of properties that can be altered.  These properties are listed in
	the upper right-hand portion of the screen.  To alter a property,
	click on the desired property to see a list of available choices.
	Some thing properties are:
	 
	  * Thing Type
		- Robot
		- Item
		- Start & Co-op Starts
		- Reactor
		- Hostage
	  * Robot "Drop" Behaviour
		- Nothing: robot destroyed -> no item
		- Default: robot destroyed -> "random item" (depends on type of 
		  robot, mostly energy boost and shield)  (Which item and how
		  many is probably defined in the .POF files).
		- Robot: Yes, a destroyed robot can drop more robots..and
		  it can drop many of them!
		- Item: You can customize what a robot drops, and how many
		  items it drops.
	  * Robot Beahviour (Hide, Sit Still, etc.)
	  * Player Number (to which player does the thing pertain)

	An Item consists of an effect and a graphic which may differ. So you
	can make an energy boost and disguise it as mega-missile. The default 
	for an energy boost is, of course, energy boost.

 	When you choose 'drop item' you can select the item out of a list. 
	The drop number is the number of this thing the robot drops when
	destroyed.  It may vary between 0 and 127. (DESCENT will become a bit
	slow when 127 items are on screen).  Ever destroyed a class 1 drone
	and recieved 127 mega-missiles? :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part [I]. Special Things

--[I1]------ Reactor

	The reactor is your goal.  When you destroy it, you have 50 seconds
	to leave the level through the defined exit(s), or you parish 
	along with everything else.  In Descent, there are two ways (that I
	have figured out) that the reactor can be defined.
	
	  * The most common type of reactor is simply the Reactor thing, 
	    which looks a bit like the old MCP in the movie "Tron".  Such
	    a reactor is inserted as any other thing, but has the 
	    additional requirement of needing to be placed within a cube
	    that is defined as a reactor cube.  (Apart from all the 
	    techie stuff within the game that defines this need, it allows
	    the reactor cube(s) to be seen in red on your Automap).

	  * As learned through Level 7, a "Big Boss 1" robot can take on
	    the characteristics of a reactor.  (That is, when you destroy
	    a Big Boss 1 robot, the destruction countdown starts and all
	    specially marked exit doors will open).  I have tried to find
	    out if the same rule applies to "Big Boss 2", but I have never
	    survived long enough to kill one!  :-)

--[I2]------ Exit

	Defining the exit and exit door(s) is a little bit more complicated
	than other things in DEVIL.  

	  * First, there are exit doors.  These are walls that are defined
	    with the "open at end" attribute.  These doors will not open 
	    until after the reactor has been destroyed.

	  * Second, there are the exit switches.  When you pass through these
	    switches, the computer takes control of your ship and steers it
	    through the last corridor until the real exit is reached (see 
	    next bullet).  These switches can be defined to activate the
	    normal exit (which takes you to the next level in the mission),
	    or the alternate exit (which takes you to one of the "secret"
	    levels).

	  * Third, one side in the level must be defined as the exit side.
	    The exit side is defined as a side that is not adjacent to 
	    any other cube, and is typically placed at the end of a long
	    corridor that connects one of the exit doors with the exit
	    side.  

	Thus, a typical exit consists of 'stay open, switch', 'open at end',
	and the switch 'normal exit'.  The exit-side is the only side that 
	is a wall (not quite right but it should do). Therefore you should
	bend the corridor so that the exit wall can't be seen from the
	beginning of the exit-corridor (because of HOM-effects). I've not
	done so because it's only a stylistic fault and won't do any harm.
	The exit wall has no texture and should therefore be invisible from 
	the point of the door (DESCENT won't crash but it looks better). This 
	can be made by curves in the exit-corridor or by just setting the 
	light level very low.

	IMPORTANT: DESCENT seems to need an exit (we aren't 100% sure). When 
	you load a level without exit it will crash sometimes/sometimes not, 
	depending of the time, your age and the current moon-phase. This 
	freaked us a lot but we thinks we have sorted it out by now.
	The exit-corridor should also have a certain minimal length (try 
	around 10 cubes at least) and it shouldn't have sharp corners (no 
	90 turns).

--[I3]------ Light

	There are two different kinds of light: cube-light and point-light.  
	Point light is only available on sides, NOT on walls, and it can be
	edited in the following modes:
  
	  * Point-mode: change the light level of the corner of the 
	    current side   
	  * Side-mode : change the light level of all 4 corners
	  * Cube-mode : change the light level of all corners in the cube

	Now we have a problem. Imagine a cube with 6 adjacent cubes (on each
	side of the cube). Such a cube has only walls and no sides and there-
	fore no light level. But 'lo! Parallax has made something called 'cube 
	light'. This sets the light level in the cube. It is only available in 
	cube-mode. So it is possible to make a big, dark room (point-light set 
	to 0) with a floating reactor in the middle in bright light. 
	Looks GREAT!  The light value is entered as a percentage of the  
	maximum amount (100%).

	The menu option "Edit->Light Shading" can be used to make a corridor 
	with a very light start cube and a pitch-dark end cube. Just tag cubes 
	so they're forming a corridor, then set the light of the start side 
	which is the side in the startcube opposite of the next tagged cube and 
	the light of the endside. Then use 'Edit->Light shading'. DEVIL will 
	then shade each corner seperately from start to end side. The inner cube 
	light is also shaded.
   	The following algorithm is used to set the lights:
	(0) 'current side'=start side, 'light'=start light, 'light add'
	    =difference between start and end light divided through the number
	    of cubes.
	(1) set the light on the 'current side' in each corner to the
	    corresponding 'light'.
	(2) add 'light add' to 'light'. Set the inner cube light to the average
	    of all eight corners. 
	(3) set light at the opposite side of the 'current side' to 'light'.
	(4) search side with next cube. 'current side' is the side of the
	    next cube which corresponds to the found side.
	(5) if this is not the end cube jump to (1).

--[I4]------ Bitmap Manipulation

	* Fit bitmap. ('Edit->Fit bitmap')

	  With this function you can move the textures on the sides. Just
	  move/turn around with the normal move/turn keys/buttons (incr.&decr. 
	  of rotation angle&moving factor work also). In 'Move'-mode you will
	  move the shape, in 'Modify'-mode you can stretch and turn the shape.
	  The following keys have special functions:
		- 'g': Recalculate the shape of the side.
		- 'G': Fit the bitmap on the side. The bitmap will be 
		       stretched so it fits on the side. Useful if you want
		       to make large doors/signs.
		- 'f': Leave fit bitmap-mode and save changes.
		- 'F': Leave fit bitmap-mode and store changes to all tagged
		       sides.
		- 'Esc': Leave fit bitmap-mode and discard changes.

	* Align bitmaps. ('Edit->Align bitmaps')

	  This feature you can use to align bitmaps so all bitmaps fit 
	  together.  To do this, tag all sides you want to align, and then go 
	  with the current side on one of these sides. Then make 
	  'Edit->Align Bitmaps'. DEVIL will take the current side and align all 
	  tagged sides in the neighbour cubes (but only one per cube) which have 
	  a line with the current side common and untag them. Then it goes on 
	  with the aligned sides and repeats this as often as there are tagged 
	  sides in the neighbour cubes with common lines.

	* Recalculate textures. ('Edit->Recalculate Textures')

	  Just recalculates the shape of the side in texture-space. This you
	  need only if you've locked several sides and now want to recalculate 
	  their shape in texture-space. Normally this is done automatically by 
	  DEVIL.

--[I5]------ "Direct" Editing

	This is for pro's only. You can choose this mode via the pulldown
	menus (Drawing -> Data). Then the hex-code of the current object is
	displayed on the right of the screen. You may edit them directly by 
	mouse-clicking on the hex-code and entering new values. [PAGE UP] and 
	[PAGE DOWN] scrolls up and down. The coloured numbers are known, the 
	black ones ain't (they're set to zilch by DEVIL). So if you know what 
	a certain address stands for, e-mail us. We will ask Parallax about 
	the unknown bytes but I think if there are many people asking, things 
	will go faster for us ;-)

	We've just seen that Parallax has published the Specs so don't bother
	them just now, read the Specs first and ask afterwards.

Part [J]. Samples

--[J1]------ The Tutorial Levels

	DEVIL comes with three "tutorial" levels (TUT1, TUT2, and TUT3) that
	illustrate the development of a level through several steps, with 
	level TUT3 being the final product.

	TUT1 doesn't contain much that is interesting.  The level consists
	of two corridors that form a "T".  The exit-side is defined at the
	top of the upward sweeping corridor, and the start point is defined
	at the left-most cube of the horizontal corridor (as you are 
	oriented when you first enter DEVIL).  Note that the icon 
	representing your starting position shows that when you start the
	level, you will be facing the left wall, not down the main 
	corridor!

	TUT2 adds two doors (walls).  The door at the end of the
	horizontal corridor will be defined with red-key access, and will
	hide the reactor behind it.  The door blocking the vertical 
	corridor will be defined as an "open at end" door, and will give
	you access to the exit after the reactor has been destroyed.  This
	door will also be defined as the "normal exit" switch.

	TUT3 is the final product, with the exit door fully defined, the
	reactor placed a reactor cube, and a red key placed in the middle 
	of the horizontal corridor.  Note also that the icon representing 
	the reactor has it positioned up-side down!

--[J2]------ The Demo Level

	I'll just describe what you see when you fly through this level.
	First, there is a two-sided (means two different events, depending 
	on your direction) switch for the producers. Then there is an
	energy-station (note: try to achieve a high 'wall-density' in
	energy-stations because	when you turn you see that the flecks in 
	the air are just 2D). Next, another two-sided switch for two secret
	doors. The door to the left is 'open/close w. switch' (means: it 
	will close after some time), the other is 'not normally opened' and
	will stay open when opened once via switch. First type is great for
	secret doors with goodies behind, second is for traps with robots
	(remember Level 6?).  Then you'll pass a door and enter a BIG BALL
	(my first real macro :). This room may be a bit slow on some 
	machines (mine for example).  There will be another enemy and the
	reactor.  Notice the mind-wheeling effect corridor <-> ball?

Part [K]. Hints and Tips

	Here are just some tips what you should try (or not try):

	  - don't make the exit-corridor too short/straight (see "Exit")
	  - insert the reactor in standard cubes so that they won't float 
	    (or steer them to the floor in a bigger room)
	  - default texture for doors is rock001; you don't see it a lot 
	    but change the texture to match adjacent textures 
	  - ceiling (lights) and floor (tiles) should remain the same 
	    through the whole level
	  - monitors and signs should be orientated in the same way
	  - Make a lot of macros.  Building rooms, corridors, etc., can 
	    be easy but time consuming.  Build up a stock of macros, then
	    piece them together to create your level(s).
	  - Make sure nothing is "out of bounds" (outside the cubes)
	  - Keep your brains with you...don't put a red key behind 
	    a red door, for example.
	  - when you make a macro for public use, try to end it with
	    a standard cube (reference point and side)
	  - thank PARALLAX every day
	  - be happy :)
