******************************************************************************
  
[0] Introduction.

 [0a] What this file is for&how you use it.
  This manual is a reference manual. Therefore if you're a beginner with
  DEVIL you should at least read the Tutorial (BUILDLEV.DOC). Here you can
  find a complete list of the functions of DEVIL and their exact behaviour.
 
  I only refer to the menupoints, not to the hotkeys in this manual.
  Referring to the menupoints is done with 'menu->menupoint', so if you're
  searching the description of a special function try to search it this way
  (try case insensitive search).
 
  All sections with a '+' in the contents are new or changed since the last
  release of DEVIL (V1.0c).
  
 [0b] Definitions.
  Here are some words and their meaning:
   -origin,x/y/z-axis: These words refer to the permanent, not changing
    coordinate system of the level.
   -your origin,x/y/z-axis: This is your own coordinate-system. The origin
    is in the middle of your screen, the x-axis goes horizontal on your
    screen (from left to right), the y-axis goes vertical on your screen
    (from bottom to top) and the z-axis goes through the middle of your
    screen (from your eyes in the level).
   -cube: a thing with eight points and six sides.
   -side: a cube has six sides.
   -wall: a door/switch/texture.
   -thing: robots/powerups/hostages/starting places/reactor.
   -object: cubes/sides/walls/things.
   
******************************************************************************

[1] Basics.
 [1a] The different modes.
  There are five different modes in DEVIL:
   Cube, Side, Point, Wall and Thing mode.
  You can change between the modes with the buttons on the right side of
  the screen in the middle. You can see there also the 'Internal' button.
  This button only changes the menu above these buttons, but not the
  mode.
  
  There are also five current objects in DEVIL:
   -the current cube is marked green.
   -the current side on the current cube is marked with a violet, a yellow
    and two red lines.
   -the current point is marked with a red 3D-cross.
   -the current wall is marked green.
   -the current thing is marked green.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 [1b] Tagging.
  'select->tag': tag current object.
  'select->tag all: tag all objects of current mode
   (i.e. in cube mode, tag all cubes).
  'select->tag special': is only useful in two modes:
   -In point mode you tag all corners of the current point.
   -In side mode you can lock this side, this means, the texture of this side
    is not calculated automatically anymore if the shape of the side changes.
  'select->use cube tag': works only in side/point-mode. Tags all 
   sides/points of the tagged cubes (other tags in this mode are cleared).
  'select->use side tag': works only in point-mode. Tags all points of
   the tagged sides (other tags in this mode are cleared).
  'select->tag box': if box is off, draw tag box on the last position. 
   if box wasn't drawn before you do this, the tag box is inited at the last
   loaded starting place as a cube with 30*gridsize as size (direction of the
   starting place).
   If tag box is already on, tag all objects of current mode in box.
   (cubes&sides are only tagged if they're completely in the box).
  'select->new tag box': if box if off, init the tag box 45*gridsize for your
   nose with size=30*gridsize aligned on your current direction.
   If tag box is already on.
  shift+left button: you can drag up a two-dimensional tag box on
   your screen. If you press the left button again, all objects of
   the current mode in this box as far as you can see are tagged.
   (cubes&sides only if they're completely in the box).
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
 [1c] Moving around.
  The seven/eight buttons in the lower right corner with the arrows:
 
  There are two modes for moving in DEVIL:
   -Moving yourself (lowest button='Move')
   -Moving things (lowest button='Modify')
  If the tagbox is on the 'Move'-mode splits up in two modes:
   -Moving yourself (lowest, right button='You').
   -Moving the box (lowest, right button='Box').
  Turning is not affected by the lowest, right button, only moving.
  
  If you're in 'Move'-mode, the tag box is off and you press the left button
  you turn yourself around the axis of the arrow, if you press the right
  button you move in the direction of the arrow:
   -left/right upper button: your neg./pos. z-axis.
   -middle upper/lower button: your pos./neg. y-axis.
   -lower left/right button: your neg./pos. x-axis.
  
  If you're in 'Move'-mode and the tag box in on and you press the right
  button, you'll move the box, not yourself. Left button is unchanged.
 
  If you're in 'Modify'-mode it depends on the current mode what you're
  moving:
   -Cube mode: You move all tagged cubes in the direction of your axis'.
   -Side mode: Same with sides.
   -Point mode: Same with points.
   -Wall mode: You can't move walls, you must move the side with the wall.
   -Thing mode: If the thing has it's own direction (is a little ship)
    you move/turn the thing in his own coordinate system. Otherwise you 
    move the thing in your coordinate system.
    
  Also you can use the following menu-points:
   'move->beam to current object': sets your position near to the current
    object.
   'move->align to ...': aligns your direction to the given axis.
         
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 [1d] The grid.
  You can turn on/off the grid with 'edit->grid on/off'. If the grid is
  turned on all moved points/things are snapped to the grid. The grid
  size is changed with 'g' and 'G'.
         
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 [1e] Selecting current object.
  You can select your current object by clicking on the screen:
   -left button: select thing (you must click the middle point of
    the not-drawn line if you want to click a ship).
   -right button: select cube/side/point. You must click one point 
    of the cube: the point becomes the current point, the nearest
    side becomes the current side and the nearest cube becomes the
    current cube.
   -shift+right button: select wall (you must click on the intersection
    of the four lines).
  'select->next cube', 'select->next side', 'select->next point',
  'select->next thing, 'select->next wall':
   cube/side/point/thing/wall with the next number. if the current object
   is the last one, select number 0.
  'select->prev cube', 'select->prev side', 'select->prev point',
  'select->prev thing, 'select->prev wall':
   cube/side/point/thing/wall with the previous number. if the current object
   is the first one, select the last one.
  'select->choose cube', 'select->choose wall', 'select->choose thing':
   select the current object by number.
  'select->change to sidecube':
   if the current cube has a neighbour cube at the current side, select
   this neighbour cube as current cube.
  'select->go to wall':
   set current cube&side to the cube&side with the current wall.

******************************************************************************
  
 [2] The menu on the right side.
  Only special entries are mentioned in the sections to the menus.
  
  [2a] Moving in the menu.
   In the menu on the right side you see a '*' before the current entry.
   You can move this '*' with 'cursor up' and 'cursor down' and change the
   entry with 'return'. 
   
   Sometimes when you select an item the current menu is replaced by a list of
   possible choices. You can select an item from this list with 'space' or
   'return' or the left mousebutton. The old value is marked with
   a '#'. You can scroll up and down with 'page up' and 'page down' or
   the right mousebutton in the upper/lower half of the list, go
   to the beginning of the list with 'Home' and to the end with 'End'.
   If you go in the line with the topic, you can enter a number which is
   not available on the list.
   
   If there's more than one item to select, 'space' marks the
   items and 'return' ends the selection and changes the entry. With 'Esc'
   you can end the selection without changing the entry. 
   
   If not explicit stated, the change is done with all tagged objects.
   You can avoid this by pressing 'ctrl' when selecting the item.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2b] Side effects.
   Some menu entries have side effects when changed. That means that DEVIL
   changes more than just the entry you've selected. You can suppress 
   side effect by pressing 'shift' when selecting the entry you would like
   to change. You can also combine 'shift'+'ctrl' to change only the current
   object without tagged objects and without any side effects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2c] Cube menu.
   cube type:
    -normal: just a normal cube.
    -fuel center: an energy station.
                  'value' has no further meaning.
    -repair center: won't work at all.
    -reactor: you must set the cube with the reactor to this type.
     DEVIL will warn you when you try to save a level with a reactor in
     a 'normal'-cube.
    -producer: a materialization center for robots.
               If you select 'produces' you will get the list of robots
	       the center produces. If you've selected more than one
	       robot-type, DESCENT will select the type randomly each time
	       a robot is produced. Every producer produces 3 robots if
	       activated and can be activated 3 times.
   cube light: The light in the inner cube. Robots&the reactor and
    other players are affected by this.
   avg.p. light: The average of the light in the corners of this cube.
    If you change this value the light of all corners of this cube is changed
    to the given value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2d] Side menu.
   origin for t2: you can turn the second texture around 0, 90, 180 and
    270 degrees on the first texture with this.
   avg.p. light: The average of the light in the corners of this side.
    If you change this value the light of all corners of this side is changed
    to the given value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2e] Point menu.
   txt-x, txt-y: The position of this point in the two-dimensional 
    texture-space. You can change this value, but better is if you use
    'edit->fit bitmap'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2f] Thing menu.
   type: the type of the thing.
    If you change this, the ID (i.e. type of robot) is also changed 
    (of course). The orientation of the object is not affected if you
    change from an object with orientation to an object without.
    In the line below this line is the ID of the object.
    -robot:
     drop type: what for a thing is dropped by this robot.
      -nothing: I'm not quite sure if this is really nothing.
      -default: The robot drops sometimes an item. Which one and how
       often is probably defined in the .pof-files.
     behaviour: 'path' and 'hide' won't work in DESCENT, :-(.
     texture: if you want to change the texture of a robot. The robot
      is then only in this texture, so you have no eyes etc. anymore.
    -hostage: The head of the hostage is in the top-direction of a ship.
     no: useless, I think.
    -item: something to pickup.
     graphics: Well, if you think it's funny you can change this, but
      normally it's changed automatically with the ID.
    -reactor: the reactor. Only one per level and don't forget to change
     the cube type.
     texture: You can change the texture of the reactor. But makes this
      really sense?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2g] Wall menu.
   Part of the entries in this menu are changed also on the corresponding wall
   on the other side of the wall (marked with D). Suppress this with pressing
   shift when selecting the entry.
   wall-type (D):
    -blow door: This door opens only if you shoot at it. Hitpoints
       are set automatically to 100 (normal hostage door).
      animation (D): Select the animation for your door here. Sets 
       automatically the texture1&texture2 on both sides.
    -normal door:
      open-at-end: This door opens if the reactor is blown up.
      key (D): the key you need to open the door.
  switchtype:
   -alternate exit: if you fly through this exit and in your msn-file
     a secret level is available for this level, you enter the secret-level.
   -normal exit: normally exit the mine.
   -producer: if you select this all tagged producers are activated by this
     switch. 
    switches: how many producers are triggered by this switch?
     (you can't change this value). The producers currently triggered
     are marked red.
   -open door: if you select this all tagged doors are opened by this switch.
    switches: how many doors are opened by this switch?
     (you can't change this value). The doors currently triggered are marked
     red.
  hitpoints: If you set this to a value, you can blow the wall up,
   independent of it's type.
  texture1&texture2: The textures on both sides of the wall. If you want
   to change just one wall, try changing texture in side mode.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2h] Internal menu.
   Zoom: this determines your viewing-angle 
    (changed with '+' & '-' in 'Move'-mode).
   ZoomS: the multiplier for '+' and '-'.
   Visib.: how far you can see ('A' and 'Y' or 'Z').   
   VisiS.: multiplier for 'A' and 'Y'.
   Movef.: the (damned, what the word for 'Schrittweite') for yourself
    (changed with '*' and '/').
   PMovef.: the %$&(%&$%% for objects.
   MoveS.: multiplier for '*' and '/'.
   Angel: the rotation angle for yourself (changed with '7' and '9').
   PAngel: the rotation angle for things.
   AngelS: multiplier for '7' and '9'.
   Grid: gridsize ('g' and 'G').
   GridS: multiplier for 'g' and 'G'.
   ConnD.: the distance two points can have if you try to connect them
    with 'makeroom' or 'delete' in side mode.
   UConn.: the distance two points can have if you try to connect them
    while inserting a macro.
   clickangle: this is the angle of the 'magical beam' used for clicking.
    If you click a spot on the screen, a cone is created, with the top on
    the screen and the nearest object is clicked. Be careful, this
    is the cosine of the angle.
   thingsize: size of the little 3d-crosses.
   door bend: the distance between the side and the middle-point of the wall.
   xpos, ypos, zpos: your current position.
   map angle: this is for the DESCENT-like map. All lines between two sides
    are drawn when the angle between the two sides is larger than this
    angle. This is the cosine of this angle.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [2i] Data.
   With 'drawing->data' you can toggle drawing of the data-structure
   which is corresponding with the current object so you can modify
   the bytes by yourself.

******************************************************************************

 [3] Inserting&Deleting objects.
  [3a] Cube mode.
   'edit->insert': Insert the current macro on the current side. The macro
    is inserted in a way that the point which was the current point when
    creating this macro lays on the current point. After inserting the
    macro all objects of the macro are tagged.
   'edit->insert special': Insert the current macro like in 'edit->insert'
    but also connect the side from the macro with the side of the level.
    The shape of the side of the macro is changed if they don't fit
    together and if DEVIL can find the points belonging together.
   'edit->delete': Delete all tagged cubes. On the sides where they have
    neighbour cubes is a standard-side inserted. If there's a wall in
    the cube, the cube is not deleted.
   'edit->enlarge': Make the current cube bigger. The center of the cube is
    calculated and then the distance of all points to this center is 
    multiplied with the zoom factor (ZoomS. in 'internal'-menu).
   'edit->shrink': Make the current cube smaller. Same as enlarge but 
    with dividing instead of multiplying.
   'macros->insert scaled': Insert the current macro like in 'edit->insert',
    but scale it with a given factor.
   'macros->insert fast,scaled': Insert the current macro like in
    'edit->fast insert', but scale it with a given factor.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [3b] Side mode.
   'edit->insert special': If the current side is a connection between two
    cubes, you insert a side in both sides of the cubes, therefore
    you kill the connection. You don't double the points this way,
    so if you move the point belonging to one of the both cubes you still
    also change the other cube (you can avoid this with 'fast insert'
    or with inserting points). You can't do this with sides with walls.
   'edit->insert': Like 'insert special' but the cubes are seperated 
    completely, so you can move one of the cubes independent from the
    other one.
   'edit->delete': Delete all tagged sides&the current side, therefore make
    connections between the side which is tagged and an opposite side which 
    DEVIL tries to find. If DEVIL doesn't find this side, try to make the
    connection more obvious (the distance between the points smaller,
    the maximum distance is ConnD. in the internal menue).
   'edit->special delete': Connect the side which is tagged with the current
    side. DEVIL tries to find the corresponding points. If the connection
    is ambiguous, try to make the connection more obvious
    (the distance between the points smaller, the maximum distance is UConn.
    in the internal menue).
   'edit->enlarge': Make the current side bigger. The center of the side is
    calculated and then the distance of all points to this center is 
    multiplied with the zoom factor (ZoomS. in 'internal'-menu).
   'edit->shrink': Make the current side smaller. Same as enlarge but 
    with dividing instead of multiplying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [3c] Point mode.
   'edit->insert': If you do this with a point which is involved in more
    than one cube, all sides of the current cube depending on this point
    are inserted, so you can move this point independent from the other
    cubes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [3d] Thing mode.
   'edit->insert': Insert the standard item.
   'edit->delete': Delete all tagged items.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [3e] Wall mode.
   'edit->insert': Insert a standard wall at the current side.
   'edit->delete': Delete all tagged walls.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [3f] All modes.
   'edit->delete all': Delete all tagged objects in every mode. This is
    useful if you've inserted a macro the wrong way because it deletes
    all things&walls&cubes. You're asked before DEVIL deletes all tagged
    objects.
   'macros->make macro': Save all tagged cube and tagged things as a macro
    in memory. All walls between two tagged cubes are copied also. The
    current side is the side which will be connected when inserting
    the macro (further description see 'insert' in cube mode).
   'macros->save macro': Save the macro from memory to disk.
   'macros->choose macro': Choose a macro from disk.
     
******************************************************************************

 [4] Special functions.
  [4a] Set exit. ('edit->set exit')
   With this function you can set the exit side at the end of the exit
   corridor. The exit corridor starts with the exit door and ends with
   the exit side (it's the corridor where DESCENT steers your glider).
   Just set the exit on the last wall of the corridor. Sometimes
   DESCENT will end the game directly after you've flown through the
   exit door (I think the corridor never works with the .msn-files but I 
   hope I get a fix until next release).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [4b] Fit bitmap. ('edit->fit bitmap')
   With this function you can move the textures on the sides. Just move/turn
   around with the normal move/turn keys/buttons (incr.&decr. of 
   rotation angle&moving factor work also). In 'Move'-mode you will
   move the shape, in 'Modify'-mode you can stretch and turn the shape.
   The following keys have special functions:
    -'g': Recalculate the shape of the side.
    -'G': Fit the bitmap on the side. The bitmap will be stretched so it
     fits on the side. Useful if you want to make large doors/signs.
    -'f': Leave fit bitmap-mode and save changes.
    -'F': Leave fit bitmap-mode and store changes to all tagged sides.
    -'Esc': Leave fit bitmap-mode and discard changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [4c] Align bitmaps. ('edit->align bitmaps')
   This feature you can use to align bitmaps so all bitmaps fit together.
   To do this, tag all sides you want to align, and then go with the current
   side on one of these sides. Then make 'edit->align bitmaps'. DEVIL will
   take the current side and align all tagged sides in the neighbour cubes
   (but only one per cube) which have a line with the current side common
   and untag them. Then it goes on with the aligned sides and repeats this
   as often as there are tagged sides in the neighbour cubes with common
   lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [4d] Light shading. ('edit->light shading')
   This function can be used to make a corridor with a very light start cube
   and a pitch-dark end cube. Just tag cubes so they're forming a corridor,
   then set the light of the start side which is the side in the startcube
   opposite of the next tagged cube and the light of the endside. Then
   use 'edit->light shading'. DEVIL will then shade each corner seperately
   from start to end side. The inner cube light is also shaded.
   The following algorithm is used to set the lights:
   (0) 'current side'=start side, 'light'=start light, 'light add'=difference
       between start and end light divided through the number of cubes.
   (1) set the light on the 'current side' in each corner to the
       corresponding 'light'.
   (2) add 'light add' to 'light'. Set the inner cube light to the average
       of all eight corners. 
   (3) set light at the opposite side of the 'current side' to 'light'.
   (4) search side with next cube. 'current side' is the side of the
       next cube which corresponds to the found side.
   (5) if this is not the end cube jump to (1).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [4e] Make room. ('edit->make room')
   This is useful if you want to make big rooms. It deletes all sides between
   tagged cubes. Just tag all cubes you want to connect execute this function.
   It will search for every side without a connection a corresponding side.
   A corresponding side is found if a side is found with all four points
   nearer than 'ConnD' from the 'internal'-menu. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [4f] Recalculate textures.
   Just recalculates the shape of the side in texture-space. This you need
   only if you've locked several sides and now want to recalculate their
   shape in texture-space. Normally this is done automatically by DEVIL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  [4g] Drawing modes.
   With 'drawing->cubes', 'drawing->things', 'drawing->walls' you can
   turn on/off the drawing of the named objects. 'drawing->data' is
   described in the 'Data' section in the 'Menu' chapter.
   'drawing->lines' calculates a while and then presents a DESCENT-like
   map. You can move points in this map and do all other things.
