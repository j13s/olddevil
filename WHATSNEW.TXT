Hi.

This is a short remark to well experienced Devil users.
For further documentation look at the file readme.txt and the file
docs/userman.doc. There's a complete german documentation for V2.1
in the file docs/german.doc (in Word for Windows 6.0 format which
is not very useful). It would be fine if someone could translate it to 
English. If you want to do it, please contact me, because I'm currently 
updating this manual to V2.2 (and please use plain ASCII text format).

This is the full version of Devil V2.1h.
Please, please e-mail all bugs you encounter to the Mailing List. 

FOR DESCENT 2 MODE, DEVIL NEEDS THE MEDIUM (48MB) INSTALLATION. Sorry about
this, but I can't access the data from the CD, it is packed (I think).
I will see if I can change this with the next version.

Fixed problems/changes (V2.1g->V2.1h):
-reading D1 producers.
-conversion table is now working in a good way (thanks to Jon Barnhart and
 Ed Newton)
-fixed a bad bug with creating macros with switches switching doors
-fixed the trouble with more than one switch in D1 mode.
-fixed trouble with loading DesEdit levels 

A BIG thanks to all guys at the mailing list and all others for bug reporting
and making suggestions.

This is still a prerelease, so be careful and make backups of your levels. 

If you have any questions, please mail them NOT to me directly but to the NEW
Devil Mailing List (see readme.txt) -- thanks to Stephen P. Clouse who
worries about it. I am subscribed in the new mailing list, too, so I will
receive everything you send to it (and a lot of other people will receive it,
too, and can answer your questions).

Have a good time,
Achim

PS: 
Currently there are two Devil versions available: This one and
V2.2a. V2.2a might be full of bugs because it is full of
new features...
