Hi.

This is a short remark to well experienced Devil users.
For further documentation look at the file readme.txt and the file
docs/userman.doc. There's a complete german documentation for V2.1
in the file docs/german.doc (in Word for Windows 6.0 format which
is not very useful). It would be fine if someone could translate it to 
English. If you want to do it, please contact me, because I'm currently 
updating this manual to V2.2 (and please use plain ASCII text format).

This is the full version of Devil V2.2b. If you prefer more bugfree
versions use the V2.1? releases.
Please, please e-mail all bugs you encounter to the Mailing List. 

FOR DESCENT 2 MODE, DEVIL NEEDS THE MEDIUM (48MB) INSTALLATION. Sorry about
this, but I can't access the data from the CD, it is packed (I think).
I will see if I can change this with the next version.

New features (V2.1g->V2.2b):
-Double view: If you start Devil you'll see two views from the
 same level. They're looking at the same point (the hotspot) which lies in 
 Internal/CenterDist before the left/right view.
 If the left view is looking at the front of a thing at this point
 (and the bottom of the thing is parallel to the x-axis of the left
 view) the right view is looking at the left side of this object.
 With these two views it is possible to move/turn objects along/around
 all three axis with the mouse.
 You can change between single/double view in the Internal menu.
-Moving yourself: You can move yourself like in V2.1 with the buttons/keys.
 Most of you will kill me because I've changed the sign of the
 y-axis with the buttons/keys. If you're working in double view
 you are always using the left view to move yourself.
 You can save/restore camera positions with Ctrl/Shift+F1-F10 keys.
 Ctrl+F12 is overview (you are moved back along your z-axis until
 the whole level fits on your screen, so you'll get different 
 overviews for different orientations of yourself), Shift+F12 is restore 
 position you had before you pressed Ctrl+F12. Ctrl+F11 is overview for 
 corridor (see below), Shift+F11 is back from overview for corridor.
 Moving yourself with mouse: This is completely new. You can move
 yourself with the mouse if you press the right mouse button in
 one of the two views and release it. The you can turn yourself
 by moving the mouse, you can go forward by pressing the left
 mouse button (how fast you go forward: Internal/Mousespeed).
 If you press Shift, you slide when you use the mouse.
 If you press Ctrl, you go forward/backward if you move the
 mouse forward/backward and you back if you move the mouse left/right)
 If you press Shift+Ctrl, you can turn yourself around the hotspot
 (just center a thing in the left and right view and then try it,
  you'll see what it means).
-Changing the current object: You can change the current object
 by clicking on the new current object (you can only click objects
 of the current mode). You can tag/untag objects by holding Ctrl and
 clicking on them with the left/right mouse button. You can tag/untag a group
 of things by holding Ctrl and holding the left/right mouse button
 down (tagbox). 
 Of course the old methods are still working. 
-Moving/Turning objects: Same as in V2.1 but now you can move objects
 with the mouse, too. Just change to the mode of the object
 (cube/side/pnt/thing) and click on it with the left mouse button
 and hold the mouse button down. The clicked object will be highlighted violet
 and you can move it. You can move tagged objects with
 the mouse if you press Shift. All modified cubes will be highlighted
 in violet. If you press the right mouse button after you
 pressed the left mouse button you can turn the object around your x/y-axis
 (if it is a thing you turn it around it's own x/y-axis, if not
 the object is turned around it's center, if you have tagged
 several objects, they're turned around their center). If you release
 the left mouse button after you pressed both buttons, you can
 turn the object around your z-axis (or their z-axis for things).
-Corridor Wizard: You can activate the corridor wizard via the
 menupoint edit/corridor wizard. A not connected current side
 must be selected. Devil will open a small window (Wizard Window) 
 with a few buttons and draw a number of new cubes connected with the
 current side in yellow with two little control points
 in it (looking like yellow things). The middle of the
 corridor is always running through the control points and
 the direction of the control points is the same as the
 direction of the corridor. You can change the shape
 of the corridor by moving/turning the control points (they
 can be moved like things; furthermore if you have pressed
 left, then right, then released left you can bank (as always)
 and if you move up/down you can change the size of the
 thing. If it is larger the curvature of the corridor
 in this point will be smaller and vice versa).
 The control point at the start of the corridor can only
 be turned (not moved). If you need more than two control
 points you can insert new ones with the 'Insert'-Button
 in the Wizard Window, if you have too much control points,
 you can delete it with the 'Delete'-Button. In both cases
 the shape of your corridor will change (slightly if you
 press 'Insert', a lot if you press 'Delete'). 'Delete'
 will not work every time (depends on the shape of your
 corridor). You can change the number of cubes used for
 the corridor with the 'Cubesize:' button. This is the
 average depth (size along the corridor direction)
 of a cube in the corridor. If your mouse is blocked when
 you want to move/turn a control point, a cube in your
 corridor is not valid (convex). You can turn this off
 if you turn off the Warning for convex/weird cubes
 in the Internal menu.
 There are two standard corridors available: A straight
 corridor and a ellipse. You can choose them with the
 'Type' button in the Wizard Window. If you choose 'Straight'
 you can only move (not turn) a point at the end of the
 corridor, if you choose 'Ellipse' you can move (not turn) two 
 points to set the two diameters of the Ellipse (it will
 be not a very good approximation to an Ellipse if you make
 the Ellipse very excentric, I will try to fix this mathematical
 problem in the next few days). If you change to 'Ellipse' or
 'Straight'
-Illuminate: You can illuminate parts of the mine without loosing
 the info for the other parts of the mine. Maybe you will get strange
 results at the edges of the cubes that you tagged, so you should 
 calculate the whole level again if you have completed it.
 The data for the lightsources are now in an extra file (default.ls2), you
 can load these files with the menupoint 'Set lightsource file'.
 Descent 2 lightsource files have the extension 'ls2', D1 'ls1'.
-Texture conversion: The conversion table is now complete; thanks to
 Jon Barnhart and Ed Newton. Robot textures will not be converted.
-You can save/restore your personal window positions (have a look
 in the menu "File").
 
A BIG thanks to all guys at the mailing list and all others for bug reporting
and making suggestions.

This is still a prerelease, so be careful and make backups of your levels. 

If you have any questions, please mail them NOT to me directly but to the
Devil Mailing List (see readme.txt).
I am subscribed in the new mailing list, too, so I will receive everything
you send to it (and a lot of other people will receive it, too, and can
answer your questions).

Have a good time,
Achim

PS: Next version:
 - bug fixes, I suppose.
 - a better "Fit Bitmap" feature (with zoom and several sides at once).
   Maybe I will make the "Align Bitmaps" feature a bit more intelligent
   (handling lights etc.)
 - smart mines   
 - maybe a Windows 95 version.
 - other major changes (like texture mapping and undo)
 - a lot of minor changes (i.e. dos shell, object randomizer, making
   sides coplanar, introduce a minimal visibility, autosave, rewrite
   "thing out of bounds" warning, saving the level is Devil crashes...)
