Hi.

This is a short remark to well experienced Devil users.
For further documentation look at the file readme.txt and the file
docs/userman.doc. There's a complete german documentation for V2.1
in the file docs/german.doc. I've found someone who will translate
the manual to English. If you want to help him (the complete manual
are >50 pages), please send him a E-Mail (robinm@za.eds.com)

This is the full version of Devil V2.2g.

Please, please e-mail all bugs you encounter to the Mailing List. 
And please use the word "bug" somewhere in your header because all
the mails with this header will be sorted out from my mailing program
automatically.

FOR DESCENT 2 MODE, DEVIL NEEDS THE MEDIUM (48MB) INSTALLATION. Sorry about
this, but I can't access the data from the CD, it is packed (I think).

V2.2f-->V2.2g:
Changed features:
-Texture moving with Alt+mouse is now somewhat more intuitive.
-In Fit Bitmap you have now three features with the double click with the
 left mouse button: without any key resets the coordinates to the
 coordinates of the current side, with shift recalculates the coordinates
 so they fit to the side, with alt sets the coordinates to standard 
 coordinates.
-The saving of the current work if Devil crashes should work now
 for Floating Point Exceptions, too.

Fixed bugs:
-New level is working now and inserting things as well. This was the
 most stupid bug I've ever produced. I've added this bug by hand to test
 the save current work feature for crashs and forgot to remove it again. 8->
 (Bradley Schneider et al.)
-Goto pos: Reinits the grfx now, so the correct cube is rendered if render
 mode is on (myself)
-Fixed: Corridor window moving down a few pixels each time it is opened.
 (myself)
-The backup levels if Devil crashes are not deleted in the batch file anymore.
 (stupid, isn't it?) (myself) 
-If the backup levels are saved, Devil asks no stupid questions anymore 
 (myself).
-Now the correct edges are tagged if you leave/reenter Devil (myself)
-Edges/Points are removed from the screen properly if you move something
 (myself)
-The cube for the things is now initialized correct, so you'll see things
 in rendermode from the start (myself)
 
V2.2e-->V2.2f:
--------------
New/changed functions:
-The two sides in a connection can be clicked seperately.
-Devil tried to save your current work in progress if it exits with
 an assert error (doesn't work with segmentation faults).
-Fit bitmap is back. The alt+mouse thing still works (or works now, see
 below) but the old 'Fit Bitmap' is back, too. Some things have changed:
 Press left (or right, this is arbitrary if no 'Fit Bitmap'-window
 is open) mousebutton on the texture in the side window. A new window
 appears. You can move the texture in this window with the right mouse
 button (same as if you press left+alt+right mouse button in the
 level window). You can move single points with the left button.
 With a double click with the left button you can reset the coords to
 the old coords, with a double click with left button+shift you can reset
 the coords to the standard-coords (which is one texture).
 If you want to save your changes to the current wall, press the left mouse
 button on the texture button in the side window again (if you press
 the right one, the coords will be saved to all tagged sides).
 Keys are not supported (yet).
 
Fixed bugs:
-Maybe the S3 modes are working again...
-Fixed asserting errors when inserting new things (Charles Davis & Bradley
 Schneider)
-Fixed the problem with moving the corridor (was a new one, the old
 one was fixed; this one was related to untagging edges on non-existent
 sides). Probably the problem with deleting the corridor was the same one.
 (Bradley Schneider & Zefrer)
-Rearranged the colors for the tagged&current objects. They are now drawn
 in mixture between green&blue (unfortunately a real 0,255,255 is not
 availble in the Descent palette). Furthermore the current point&edge
 are green now. (Luke Schneider)
-After "New level" the current point is now correctly initialized (myself)
-Fixed problems with "Split cube" twice in a new level. Surprisingly this
 was no problem with splitting cubes or connecting cubes but a problem
 in the initialization of a new level (needed three hours to find this
 &%$!"&% bug). (Bradley Schneider)
-Deleting a cube should now work always. (Bradley Schneider)
-The problem with tagging pnts should not appear again. I'm not sure here
 but I suppose the pointer to current point wasn't valid anymore, and the
 two problems mentioned may be related to this. (Bradley Schneider)
-Moving pnts/things is possible again. My pointer to the functions were
 messed up because of the new edge mode. Sorry. (Bradley Schneider)
-The reactor time is in seconds for Insane. The other levels are as follows:
  Trainee *3.0, Rookie *2.5, Hotshot *2.0, Ace *1.5, Insane *1.0 
 (thanks to Brian Aamot&all the others for this list)
-Deleting tagged cubes works for me...maybe this was the same problem as
 the one with deleting one cube. (Bradley Schneider)
-Moving the texture with the alt key works now as it should (no jumps
 after moving the texture with shift+alt). (Axis Experience)
-Fixed problems with entering point coordinates directly (John Ratcliff &
 Owen P Evans)
 
V2.2d-->V2.2e:
--------------

New (changed) features:
-Introduced a new type of object/mode: Edges. The current point is now fully 
 independent from the current cube and contains only the coordinate
 data of this point. The edges are the four corners of one side containing
 the lighting/uv data. 
-You can change reactor time&strength
-A new button in the side window: 'Locked'. Shows if a side is locked
 (you can still lock a side via Special Tag or alt+space in side mode). The
 uv-coords of a locked side won't be changed.
-Special tag in edge-mode tags all three edges corresponding to one point
 in the current cube. Special tag in pnt-mode tags all edges of this
 point. Special tag in side mode locks the side. In other modes
 special tag has no meaning.
-Tab is now change movemode again and turning double view on/off is now
 d instead of tab.

Bug fixes:
-Fixed a 'Floating Point Exception' in the texture mapping routines.
 I hope it is much more stable now.
-Fixed problems with moving the corridor with the mouse (it is not possible
 to 'select' the yellow corridor markers and you can now move the
 corridor markers even when they are far away)
 

V2.2c-->V2.2d:
--------------

New features:
-The RL2 files version 7 are now fully supported (so you can load DMB
 levels but not levels from the Vertigo series because you need some
 additional data (pig-files and so on) to handle this levels)
-Blinking lights are now available (if you have Descent V1.1 or better)
-You can tag single corners now with Alt+Space (in Point mode) and all
 corners with Alt+Shift+Space. Then you can change all the light values
 of the tagged corners with pressing the right mousebutton on one of
 the four light fields (which will be changed, too, of course). This
 is not the best solution but it is one I could do quickly. Maybe I will
 make an additional window for the corners but I have to think about this.

Fixed Bugs:
-Problems with crashing Devil if you turn on rendering/change display options
 without a level
-You can now click&tag pnts (it seems that I've forgotten to program this?!)
-Fixed the problem with moving the pnts the old way (with the buttons)
-Added the run.bat-File (don't know why this was not in the zip file ?)
-The message window now disappears if you press a key.
-The graphic errors if you change the current thing are fixed.
-Fixed bug with 'New level'.
-Hopefully fixed problems with the producers in Descent 1 mode.
-Fixed the problem with tagging walls.

V2.2b-->V2.2c:
--------------

New features:
-Moving yourself: I've changed the key definitions to achieve similar 
 key/mouse functions when you're moving yourself/objects. So most of you
 will probably kill me (again) because they will always press the wrong 
 key/button first but I hope you will get used to these definitions soon:
 You can move yourself if you press the right mouse button in the level
 window and hold it down (NEW):
 -If you press nothing else, you can move forward/backward and turn
  yourself around the z-axis.
 -If you press the left mouse button while you're holding down the right one
  you can turn yourself around the x/y-axis (left,right/up,down)
 -If you press shift while you're holding down the right mouse button you
  can slide right/left/up/down
 -If you press ctrl while you're holding down the right mouse button you
  will travel forward (so if you press the left mouse button, too,
  you can fly through the level)
 -If you press shift+left while you're holding down the right mouse button
  you will turn around the coord cross (if it is turned on, differs from
  pressing the left mouse button only in double view, of course)
 -It seems that ctrl+shift+left mouse button is not used ;-) but you feel
  like in a roller coaster if you try it :-).
-Clicking/Moving/Tagging an object: Press the left mouse button in the level 
 window and hold it down. You will see a white "scan circle" and in this 
 circle up to three other small purple/green circles (and if you are in 
 cube/side mode additional lines marking the cube/side). The green small 
 circle/lines mark the object which will be selected if you release the left 
 button. Of course the object nearest to the cursor will be the green one.
 You can tag the object if you press the ctrl button while you're holding
 the left button down (the tag-box is used as usual: first press ctrl and
 then the left mouse button).
 If you hold the left button down and then press the right one, too, you
 can move the object marked with the green circle in a similar manner
 like you can move yourself:
 -If you press nothing else, you can move forward/backward and turn
  yourself around the z-axis.
 -If you press the left mouse button while you're holding down the right one
  you can turn yourself around the x/y-axis (left,right/up,down)
 -If you press shift while you're holding down the right mouse button you
  can slide right/left/up/down
 If you press the ctrl-key before you press the right mouse button you will 
 move/turn all tagged objects of this mode (for this reason the ctrl
 sequences in moving yourself are the ones which make no sense for 
 object moving).
-A coord cross in the middle of the view can be turned on/off in single/double
 mode. In double mode the coord cross is at the position where the z-axis
 of the left and the right views have their intersection point.
-Tag->Tag flat sides: Tags all sides that are connected in a "flat" way
 to the current side. "Flat" means that the normal vector of the two
 sides have an angle which is not larger than the angle in the
 Internal Menu: Bitmaps&Illum.->Tag flat sides.
-The "align Bitmaps" feature can now align bitmaps in the same cube.
-The Internal Menu is somewhat reorganized
-The uvl-coords are now in the "Side" and not in the "Point" Menu. So it
 is no longer necessary to tag corners instead of points. In principle
 it is now possible to make the current point completely independent from
 the current cube but this was too much work for me in the moment...
-And last but not least: Texture mapping. There are four different
 kinds of texture mapping possible (Internal menu: Move&Display->Rendering)
 - Off: quite obvious, usual wireframe 
 - Only current cube: only the current cube is rendered.
 - On: You are beamed in the current cube and the level is displayed
    Descent like. You can fly around as you like if you leave the
    level the view is changed to "only current cube", if you enter the
    level again it is changed back. It is not that fast and it would
    be possible to optimize this a lot (especially the draw to screen
    procedure is quiet slow due to the graphics library I'm using and
    the inner loop is not Pentium-optimized at all and such stuff). I will
    focus my further work in enhancing this graphics engine and maybe I 
    will do a Devil update sometimes with a faster engine. But all in all
    it should be fast enough to have a look at the level and on a Pentium
    133 in a window not too large it should be fast enough to fly through
    the level. If you don't like the wireframe, you can turn it on/off with
    shift+tab.
  - On with collision: Same as above but now you should collide with the
    walls, so you can't leave the mine.
  The latter two modes might have a problem with recognize a collision
  with the wall (so may happen that you face a black screen). This problem
  is not a trivial one as I first thought but it hopefully will be fixed
  in one of the next versions. It doesn't happen very often but if it
  happens you can recover the correct view with ctrl+shift+space. You
  can select one of the four modes with shift+1,shift+2,shift+3,shift+4.
  Mode 3+4 only work in single view mode.
-With texture mapping it was quite obvious that my routines for
 recalculating the uv-coords of a side when a point of the side was
 moved wasn't very useful. I've changed them. 
-Moving textures: If you press alt when you're in side mode you can move
 the texture on the side instead of the side itself (of course you should
 have turned one of the texture mapping modes on if you do this otherwise
 you will see nothing).
-DMB 2 levels can now be read (but be careful: I've not programmed the
 support for the new RL2 version levels, so you will loose the data
 for the blinking lights and maybe some other things but I hope it will
 work). 
 
Fixed bugs:
-Hopefully avoided some assert-errors from insert.c line 62
-Fixed some problems with renumbering the cubes.
-Hopefully fixed the wrong shown lightsource file.
-"saved to descent directory" does not count as a "real" save, so there is
 now a further prompt if you leave the editor.
-Levels in D2 mode have now the ending .RL2 even if they were D1 levels when
 they were loaded.
-Messages for handling errors during loading a level are now much more
 meaningful (i.e. the number for the door not found for a specific cube
 is now the real number not 255)
-Zoom of texture list is saved 
-F5 mode is now turned off if you split a cube, so you don't get funny
 lines/FP exceptions anymore.
-Hopefully fixed the bug with non-convex cubes/connecting
-Fixed the bug with deleting tagged cubes and not deleting the tag list

A BIG thanks to all guys at the mailing list and all others for bug reporting
and making suggestions.

This is still a prerelease, so be careful and make backups of your levels. 

If you have any questions, please mail them NOT to me directly but to the
Devil Mailing List (see readme.txt).
I am subscribed in the new mailing list, too, so I will receive everything
you send to it (and a lot of other people will receive it, too, and can
answer your questions).

Have a good time,
Achim

PS: Next version:
 - a lot of bug fixes.
   I won't do any new major features anymore because in November I've started 
   to work on my diploma and this is quite time consuming.
   Furthermore I want to play a little bit with the texture mapping routines
   to see what I can do with them. Anyway, I will fix the bugs that are 
   reported so maybe Devil will become a somewhat stable program in a few
   months (sounds unbelievable to me ;-).
   For this reasons I won't release any V2.1? versions anymore.
